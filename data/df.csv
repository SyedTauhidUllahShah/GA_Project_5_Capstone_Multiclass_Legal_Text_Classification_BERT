In your letter, give us the following information: 
•    Your name and account number. 
•    The dollar amount of the suspected error. 
•    Describe the error and explain, if you can, why you believe there is an error. If you need more information, describe the Item you are not sure about. 
Your Rights and Our Responsibilities After We Receive Your Written Notice 
We must acknowledge your letter within 30 days, unless we have corrected the error by then. Within 90 days, we must either correct the error or explain why we believe the 
bill was correct. 
•    After we receive your letter, we cannot try to collect any amount you question, or report you as a delinquent. We can continue to bill you for the amount you question, 

including finance charges, and we can apply an unpaid amount against your credit limit. You do not have to pay any questioned amount while we are investigating, but you 
are still obligated to pay the parts of your bill that are not in question. 
•     If we find that we made a mistake on your bill, you will not have to pay any finance charges related to any questioned amount. If we didn’t make a mistake, you may 
have to pay finance charges, and you will have to make up any missed payments on the questioned amount. In either case, we will send you a statement of the amount you 
owe and the date that it is due. 
•     If you fail to pay the amount that we think you owe, we may report you as delinquent. However, if our explanation does not satisfy you and you write to us within ten 
days telling us that you still refuse to pay, we must tell anyone we report you to that you have a question about your bill. And, we must tell you the name of anyone we 
reported you to. We must tell anyone we report you to that the matter has been settled between us when it finally is. 
any tort or related claims arising from such purchases. 

•    If we do not follow these rules, we cannot collect the first $50 of the questioned amount, even if your bill was correct. Furthermore, the Credit Union has no liability for 
Special Rule for Credit Card Purchases 
If you have a problem with the quality of property or services that you purchased with a credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, 
you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the property or services. There are two limitations on this right: (a) You must have made the purchase in your 
home state or, if not within your home state, within 100 miles of your current mailing address; and (b) The purchase price must have been more than $50.  These limitations 
do not apply if we own or operate the merchant, or if we mailed you the advertisement for the property or services.
