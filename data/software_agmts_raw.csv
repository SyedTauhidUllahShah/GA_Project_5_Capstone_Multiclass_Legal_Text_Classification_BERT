after the date hereof WARNER, or WARNER and its subsidiaries,
shall have a development and marketing budget in an aggregate
amount equal to not less than 20% of anticipated Net Sales of
$5,000,000 for such period.  WARNER shall prepare and submit,
after approval by the Board of Directors of WARNER, to CCL, for
its advice and input, an annual budget plan for each of the next

expenditures of at least $333,333, and WARNER agrees to expend at

CCL.  WARNER shall submit the budget plan (1) for the first year
after the Closing Date within 30 days after the date hereof and
(2) for each of the next two years by February 28 of the next
calendar year.  The failure of WARNER to submit any annual budget
plan when required, to approve such plans (as originally proposed
or as modified with CCL's consent) within a reasonable time after
submission thereof, or to fund a development and marketing budget
pursuant to such plans or in such aggregate amount for whatever
reason, shall constitute a breach of this covenant, which breach
shall result in WARNER having a nonexclusive license of the
Licensed Rights thereafter; provided, however, that WARNER shall
have 30 days to remedy any such failure.

5.   SOFTWARE SUPPORT SERVICES.  CCL shall provide, or shall
arrange for the provision of, reasonable support services to
WARNER for the maintenance and support of the CARE Software, such
services to be provided to WARNER at usual and customary rates.
Within 60 days after the date of this Agreement, CCL and WARNER
shall enter into a written agreement with respect to the support
services to be provided (the ""Support Services Agreement"").  The
Support Services Agreement shall, to the extent commercially
foreseeable, to provide for a class of support services based
upon the support standards set forth in Attachment B hereto.
Upon execution by WARNER and CCL, the Support Services Agreement
shall be appended to and incorporated into and made a part of
this Agreement in substitution of Attachment B.

6.   TERMINATION.  Either party may terminate this Agreement upon
written notice to the other party if the other party breaches any
of the provisions herein; provided the non-breaching party has
first given the other party notice of such breach and the other
party has failed to cure such breach within thirty days after
receipt of such notice.  The Warner License terminates upon
termination of this Agreement immediately and without notice.

7.   INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.  In addition to such other rights as the
parties may have at law and in equity, the parties may, without
the requirement of posting bond, enforce the provisions of this
agreement by injunctive relief including, without limitation, by
obtaining specific performance.

8.   CONFIDENTIALITY.

A.   WARNER, CCL, and COVER-ALL shall use their commercially
reasonable best efforts to protect the trade secrets
contained in the CARE Software and shall also provide
appropriate safeguards to prevent the disclosure of the CARE
Software to any entity that has not executed an agreement
providing for the confidentiality and non-disclosure of the
CARE Software.

B.   Each party agrees and acknowledges that any Information
that is furnished or made available or otherwise disclosed
to another party pursuant to this Agreement is valuable
proprietary and/or confidential information of the
disclosing party and shall remain the property of the
disclosing party.

D.   The parties agree that all Information shall be kept
strictly confidential and shall be treated by the receiving
party and by any person authorized, pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, to have access thereto, as being valuable
confidential and proprietary Information of the disclosing
party.  The receiving party shall protect the disclosing
party's Information from unauthorized use or disclosure
using the same standard of care which it uses to protect its
own proprietary and/or confidential information.

E.   The receiving party of any Information shall not,
without the prior written consent of the disclosing party,
disclose, provide, or otherwise make available any item of
Information to any person or entity other than those of its
employees, agents, or representatives who have a need to
know such Information in order for the receiving party to
carry out its obligations or exercise its rights hereunder.
The receiving party shall require its employees, agents, or
representatives who have access to Information to be made
aware of its confidential and/or proprietary nature and of
the applicable requirements relative to maintaining the
confidence of such Information.  The receiving party shall
enforce these provisions for the benefit of the disclosing
party.

F.   The obligations and limitations set forth in this
Section shall not apply to Information that is:  (i) at any
time available to the public other than as a consequence of
a breach of this Agreement by the receiving party; (ii) at
any time rightfully received by one of the parties from a
third party which has the right to transmit and does
transmit such Information to the receiving party; (iii)
rightfully known to the receiving party without any
limitation on use or disclosure prior to receipt of such
Information, as substantiated by a writing predating the
date of this Agreement; and (iv) independently developed by
personnel of a party who have not had access to whatsoever
to such Information.

G.   The Receiving Party shall not be prohibited from
disclosing Information pursuant to a valid and effective
order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or
governmental authority having appropriate statutory powers,
but any such disclosure shall be made only to the extent so
ordered and only if the receiving party timely notifies the
disclosing party prior to such disclosure so that the
disclosing party may intervene in response to any such order
for disclosure.

H.   The obligations of this Section shall survive the
termination of this Agreement.

any and all liens or other security interests or

as set forth in the Software Documentation with respect to
the administration of worker's compensation claims in the
United States and (ii) for a period of 90 days from the date
of delivery to WARNER (a ""CCL Warranty Period""), that the
CARE Modifications delivered after the date of this

technical and functional specifications thereof.  As
WARNER's sole remedy upon the breach of the warranty set

deliver to WARNER a corrected and fully functioning version
of the CARE Software.

10.  WARNER AND COVER-ALL WARRANTIES.  WARNER and COVER-ALL
hereby make the express warranties and representations described
in this Section.

A.   WARNER and COVER-ALL each warrant and represent that it

sole remedy upon the breach of the warranty set forth in
this subsection, if CCL notifies WARNER, before the
expiration of the applicable WARNER Warranty Period, that
any such CARE Modification has failed to perform
substantially in accordance with the specifications thereof,

WARNER or COVER-ALL (each an ""Indemnitee"") harmless from and
against all damages, actions, settlements, judgments, claims, and
demands made against, recovered against, suffered by, and/or
incurred by an Indemnitee and which arise out of a claim that the
CARE Software, as delivered to WARNER or COVER-ALL, infringes the
copyright, patent, or trademark rights, or misappropriates the
trade secrets, of any entity.  CCL's indemnity in this Section
shall be subject to the following terms and conditions (for

to include ""COVER-ALL""):

A.   WARNER shall promptly notify CCL in writing when WARNER
has actual knowledge of any such claim.

B.   WARNER shall require any sublicensee to promptly notify
WARNER when such WARNER sublicensee has actual knowledge of
any such claim.  In order to avail itself of CCL's indemnity
in this Section, any WARNER sublicensee must have so
notified WARNER.

C.   CCL's indemnity of any sublicensee of WARNER shall be
limited to the extent of the underlying sublicense from
WARNER, which sublicense must be consistent with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement.

settlement, and compromise of any such claim; provided,
however, that the Indemnitee may participate in the defense
with counsel of its own choice and at its own expense.

E.   WARNER agrees, and shall require any sublicensee to
agree (if an Indemnitee), to cooperate reasonably in the
defense, settlement, and compromise of such claim at CCL's
expense, except that if an Indemnitee desires to retain its
own counsel, it shall do so at its own cost and expense.

F.   If the CARE Software becomes the subject of any such
claim, or if the CARE Software is held to constitute such an
infringement, and the use of the CARE Software by an
Indemnitee is enjoined, CCL shall, at its expense and at its
option, use its commercially reasonable best efforts either
(i) to procure for the Indemnitee the right to continue
using the CARE Software or (ii) to create CARE Modifications
to make it functionally equivalent and non-infringing.

G.   CCL shall have no liability for any such claim based
upon (i) use of other than the most current version of the
CARE Software made available to WARNER by CCL (including any
and all CARE Modifications provided to WARNER by CCL) if
such claim would have been avoided by the use of such
version or (ii) infringement resulting from WARNER's
modifications, adaptation, or enhancement of the CARE
Software.

A.   If any party to this Agreement shall become aware of
any infringement by any third party of the CARE Software in
the Licensed Territory or any misappropriation of a trade
secret by any third party relating to the CARE Software in
the Licensed Territory, it shall promptly notify the other
of such infringement.

B.   CCL, may, at its expense, institute suit against such
infringer, and WARNER shall fully cooperate with CCL to
enjoin such infringement or acts and shall, if requested by
CCL, join with CCL as a party to any action brought by CCL

with the foregoing, except that if WARNER desires to retain
its own counsel, it shall do so at its own cost and expense.

C.   If CCL, after being notified of such infringement or
misappropriation, elects not to institute suit against such
infringer, then WARNER may, at its expense, institute suit
against such infringer, and CCL shall fully cooperate with
WARNER to enjoin such infringement or misappropriation and
if reasonably necessary, shall, if requested, join with
WARNER as a party to any action brought by WARNER for such
purpose.  WARNER shall bear all expenses connected with the
foregoing, except that if CCL desires to retain its own
counsel, if shall do so at its own cost and expense.

D.   Any recovery as a result of any infringement or
misappropriation pursuant to this provision shall belong
solely to the party instituting such action.

13.  INDEMNITY.  Each party shall indemnify and hold harmless the
other party, and such other party's licensees, officers,
directors, employees, agents, and other representatives, from and
against any loss, damage, liability (including any liability by
reason of a bona fide settlement of a claim, action, suit, or
proceeding), or expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees)
arising out of or connected with any breach or inaccuracy of any
representation, warranty or covenant by it contained in this
Agreement or in any certificate or other instrument or document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement, or any claim, action, suit,
or proceeding asserted or instituted arising out of any matter or
thing covered by such representations, warranties or covenants.

In the event that either party shall breach or otherwise
fail to perform any of its obligation under this Agreement, the
non-breaching party may, at its election, and in addition to any
and all other remedies it may have under this Agreement or
otherwise, perform any such obligations.

The obligations of indemnity under this Section shall
survive all performances under this Agreement.

14.  DISCLAIMER.  EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES GRANTED IN
THE SECTION ENTITLED ""CCL WARRANTIES,""  CCL MAKES NO OTHER
WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

15.  GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE.  This Agreement shall be governed
by the laws of the State of Delaware, U.S.A., except for its laws
relating to choice of law.

16.  NO WAIVER.  No failure to exercise and no delay in
exercising any right, power, or remedy under this Agreement will
operate as a waiver.  Nor will any single or partial exercise of
any right, power, or remedy preclude any other or further
exercise of that or any other right, power, or remedy.

17.  REMEDIES CUMULATIVE.  All remedies provided for in this
Agreement are cumulative and in addition to such other remedies
as may be available at law and in equity.

18.  SEVERABILITY.  If any provision of this Agreement is
declared or found to be illegal, unenforceable, or void, then the
parties will be relieved of all obligations arising under such
provision, but only to the extent that such provision is illegal,
unenforceable, or void, it being the intent and agreement of the
parties that this Agreement will be deemed amended by modifying
such provision to the extent necessary to make it legal and
enforceable while preserving its intent or, if that is not
possible, by substituting another provision that is legal and
enforceable and achieves the same intent.  If the remainder of
this Agreement will not be affected by such declaration or
finding and is capable of substantial performance, then each
provision not so affected will be enforced to the extent
permitted by law.

19.  COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one
instrument.

20.  RELATIONSHIP OF PARTIES.  This Agreement does not create a
partnership or joint venture relationship, nor does it authorize
either party to serve as the legal representative or agent of the
other.  CCL and WARNER are independent contractors and will
remain independent contractors unless hereafter agreed otherwise
in writing.  No party will have any right or authority to assume,
create, or incur any liability or any obligation of any kind,
express or implied, against or in the name or on behalf of any
other party.

21.  ASSIGNMENT.   WARNER  may assign this Agreement only with
the prior express, written consent of CCL; provided, that,
without the consent of CCL, WARNER may assign this Agreement to
COVER-ALL and COVER-ALL, without the consent of CCL, may assign
this Agreement in connection with the transfer of all or
substantially all of COVER-ALL's assets or in connection with a
merger or consolidation of COVER-ALL into a third party.

EXHIBIT 10.26


SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT

This  Software  License  Agreement  is  made  as of  this  25th  day of
September,   1999,  between  Preferred  Voice,  Inc.,  a  Delaware   corporation
(""Licensor"") and Rural Cellular Corporation, a Minnesota corporation,  on behalf
of  itself  and its  wholly  owned  subsidiaries  and  affiliates  (""Licensee"").
Licensor  and  Licensee are  collectively  referred to in this  Agreement as the
""Parties.""

Background Information

Licensor has developed a system (the ""System"") that when interconnected
with a telecommunications switching system is capable of performing the services
(the  ""Services"")  described  in a  Marketing  Agreement  between  Licensor  and
Licensee of even date (the ""Marketing  Agreement"").  Each System consists of the
hardware,  certain third party software (the ""Third Party Software"") and certain
proprietary   application  software  developed  by  Licensor  (the  ""Application
Software"").   Licensee  is  a  wireless  carrier  that  is  currently  providing
telecommunications  service in areas  described in the Marketing  Agreement (the
""Service  Areas"").  Licensee  wishes to offer the  Services  to end users  (""End
Users"") under its own brand in conjunction with its telecommunications services,
and  Licensor has agreed to install its System in  Licensee's  location for that
purpose pursuant to the Marketing Agreement.

In  consideration  of the  mutual  promises  made  in  this  Agreement,
Licensor and Licensee  agree that the terms and  conditions set forth as follows
will apply to the license of Application Software.

ARTICLE 1. LICENSE AND PROCUREMENT

1.01 License.  Pursuant to this  Agreement,  Licensor  hereby grants to
Licensee  a  nontransferable,  non-exclusive  license  to  use  the  Application
Software, together with all subsequent improvements thereto in the Service Area.
Licensor also grants to Licensee a non-transferable, non-exclusive sublicense to
use the Third Party Software, solely in connection with operation of the System.

1.02 Term. The initial term of this Agreement shall be co-terminus with
the Marketing Agreement.

ARTICLE 2. LIMITATIONS ON USE

2.01 General Use.  Licensee agrees to use the Application  Software and
Third Party Software  solely to provide the Services to End Users.  Licensee may
private brand the Services it offers.

2.02     Location.

(a) Use of Application Software.  The Application Software may
be used only on the hardware  provided by Licensor  (""Designated  Hardware"")  at
Licensee's switch locations in the Licensed Areas.

SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT - PAGE 1



<PAGE>



(b) Temporary  Use of  Non-Designated  Hardware.  Licensee may
temporarily  install and use the  Application  Software  on hardware  other than
Designated Hardware,  but only if the Designated Hardware cannot be used because
of  hardware,  software  or other  malfunction  and only  until  the  Designated
Hardware  is  returned  to  operation.  Licensee  shall not  install  or use the
Application  Software on such  replacement  hardware  without  the prior  verbal
consent of Licensor.  Licensor shall not  unreasonably  withhold this consent if
the proposed  replacement  hardware meets or exceeds the  Specifications for the
Designated Hardware.

2.03  Copies.  Licensee may make one ""backup  copy"" of the  Application
Software for archival  purposes at each location;  any such archival copy may be
stored at the location  where the products are installed and  operational  or at
any such reputable off-site storage facility or facilities,  as the case may be,
which Licensee, in its reasonable judgment, shall select to maintain and protect
such  archival  copy for  purposes  of  disaster  recovery.  Licensee  shall not
otherwise copy any portion of the Software. Licensee shall reproduce and include
Licensor's  applicable copyright notice,  patent notice,  trademark,  or service
mark on any copies of the Application Software.

ARTICLE 3. PROPERTY RIGHTS

3.01 Title to Software.  Title to the Application  Software is reserved
for Licensor. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that Licensor is and shall remain
the owner of the  Application  Software  and shall be the owner of all copies of
the Application Software made by Licensee.

3.02  Confidentiality  of  Software.  Licensee  acknowledges  that  the
Application  Software is  confidential  in nature and constitutes a trade secret

confidence for Licensor and not to sell, rent, license, distribute, transfer, or
disclose the Application  Software or its contents,  including  methods or ideas

under  access  and use  restrictions  designated  to prevent  disclosure  of the

materials and trade secrets.

3.04  Disclosure as Breach.  Licensee agrees that any disclosure of the

hereof.

destroy any copyright, patent notice, trademark, service mark, other proprietary
markings, or confidential legends placed on or within the Software.

System;  (iii) the  Application  Software  will  permit  the  System to  provide
Services  when  properly   interconnected  to  Licensee's  functioning  switches
described in the Marketing  Agreement  (provided,  that any  modification of the

b. Year 2000. Licensor warrants that the Application  Software
delivered  or  modified  by Licensor  is, or will be,  Year 2000  Compliant  (as
defined  below).  Year 2000 Compliant  software that is intended to interoperate

""Year  2000  Compliant.""  Except as set  forth in the  preceding  sentence,  (i)
Licensor  assumes  no  responsibilities  or  obligations  to cause  third  party
products to function with the Application  Software;  and (ii) Licensor will not
be in breach of this warranty for any failure of the Application  Software to be
Year 2000 Compliant if such failure  results from the inability of any software,
hardware,  or systems of Licensee or any third party to be Year 2000  Compliant.

of the Application Software will be affected by dates prior to, during and after

specified either explicitly or by unambiguous  algorithms or inferencing  rules;

behave consistently for dates prior to, during and after the year 2000.

4.02  Remedies.  In the  event of any  nonconformity  or  defect in the
Application  Software  (or any other  breach with  respect to the  condition  or
operation  of the  Application  Software)  for which  Licensor  is  responsible,
Licensor shall, during the foregoing  respective  warranty periods,  (A) provide
reasonable efforts to correct or cure such nonconformity, defect, contaminant or
breach

SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT - PAGE 3

ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

REMEDIES, AND LICENSOR'S ENTIRE LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE IS AS SET
FORTH IN THIS  AGREEMENT.  LICENSEE  FURTHER  AGREES THAT LICENSOR  SHALL NOT BE

EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 4.05.

4.05     Indemnification.

(a)  Infringement.  Licensor  agrees  to  indemnify  and  hold
Licensee and its directors, officers, employees and agents, harmless against any
and all claims, demands, actions, losses, liabilities,  judgments,  settlements,
awards  and  costs   (including   reasonable   attorneys'   fees  and  expenses)
(collectively,  ""Liabilities"")  arising  out of or related to any claim  against
Licensee by a third party that  Licensee's  use or possession of the Third Party
Software  or  Application  Software  (or the  license or  sublicense  granted to
Licensee  hereunder  with  respect  thereto),  infringes  or violates any United
States patent, copyright or other proprietary right of any third party; provided
that  Licensee  gives  Licensor  prompt notice of any such claim of which it has
actual  knowledge  and  cooperates  fully with  Licensor  in the defense of such
claim.  Licensor shall have the exclusive right to defend and settle at its sole
discretion  and expense all suits or  proceedings  arising out of the foregoing.
Licensee  shall not have the right to settle  any  action,  claim or  threatened
action  without the prior written  consent of Licensor (at  Licensor's  sole and
absolute  discretion).  In case use of the Third Party  Software or  Application
Software  is  forbidden  by  a  court  of  competent   jurisdiction  because  of

for  Licensee  the  rights  to  continue  using  the Third  Party  Software  and
Application  Software;  (ii)  replace the  infringing  Third  Party  Software or

modify the infringing  Application  Software so it becomes  non-infringing while
materially  maintaining  the  functionality  thereof;  or  (iv)  if  none of the
foregoing  are  commercially  practicable,  remove the System and  terminate the
Marketing  Agreement and this License  Agreement  Licensor will then be released
from any further

SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT - PAGE 4



<PAGE>



obligation  whatsoever  to Licensee with respect to the  infringing  part of the
Third Party Software or Application  Software.  Nothing in this Section shall be
deemed to make Licensor  liable for any patent or copyright  infringement  suits
that arise in connection with (a) designs,  modifications,  use,  integration or
data furnished by Licensee if infringement  would have been avoided by not using
or combining the  Application  Software with such other programs or data (except
the Third Party Software) or (b) if infringement  would have been avoided by the
use of an updated version made available to Licensee.

(b) Other.  Licensor  agrees to  indemnify  and hold  Licensee
harmless  against any and all  Liabilities  arising out of Licensor's  negligent
acts or omissions, intentional torts, or material breach of this Agreement.

6.02  Headings.  Headings  used in  this  Agreement  are to  facilitate
reference only, are not a part of this Agreement, and will not in any way affect
the  interpretation  hereof.  The  use  herein  of the  word  ""including,""  when
following any general statement, term or matter, shall not be construed to limit
such  statement,  term or  matter to the  specific  items or  matters  set forth
immediately  following such word or to similar items or matters,  whether or not
non-limiting language (such as ""without limitation,"" or ""but not limited to,"" or
words of similar  import) is used with references  thereto,  but rather shall be
deemed to refer to all other  items and  matters,  that  reasonably  could  fall
within the broadest possible scope of such general statement, term or matter.

6.03  Assignment.  This  Agreement,  and  all  rights  and  obligations
hereunder,  are personal as to the parties  hereto and may not be  assigned,  in
whole or in part, by any of the parties to any other person, firm or corporation
without  the prior  written  consent  thereto by the other party  hereto,  which
consent will not be unreasonably  withheld;  except that either party may freely
assign any or all of its rights and  obligations  hereunder to any  affiliate or
any person acquiring all or  substantially  all of that party's stock or assets.
An  affiliate  is (a) an  entity  that  owns  all  or  substantially  all of the
outstanding stock of the entity so assigning, (b) an entity all or substantially
all of whose stock is owned by the entity so  assigning,  or (c) an entity under
common  ownership  with the entity so  assigning.  Such  assignee  entity  shall
thereupon be free to assign the rights and  obligations  under this Agreement to
any other affiliate.  Any assignment  contrary to the terms hereof shall be null
and void and of no force or effect.

6.04 Failure or Partial Exercises.  No failure on the part of any party
to exercise,  and no delay in exercising,  any right or remedy  hereunder  shall
operate as a waiver  thereof.  Nor shall any single or partial  exercise  of any
right or remedy  hereunder  exclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right hereunder.

6.05 Entire Agreement, Amendments. This Agreement and all schedules and
exhibits  annexed  hereto  constitute  the entire  agreement  among the  parties
respecting the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior  agreements  among
the parties  relative to the subject matter hereof.  In entering this Agreement,
Licensee did not rely on any  representations  or  warranties of Licensor or its
employees or agents other than those set forth in this Agreement. This Agreement
may not be  modified  or amended  except by a writing  that states that it is an
amendment   to  this   Agreement   and  which  is  signed  by  duly   authorized
representative of the parties.

overnight  express courier or (iv) by certified mail,  postage  prepaid,  return
receipt  requested,  deposited in any post office in the United  States,  in any

<PAGE>



6.07 Partial  Invalidity.  If any clause or provision of this Agreement
is held to be illegal,  invalid,  or unenforceable  under present or future laws
effective  during the term of this Agreement,  then and in that event, it is the
intention of the parties hereto that the remainder of this  Agreement  shall not
be  affected  thereby,  and it is also  the  intention  of the  parties  to this
Agreement  that in lieu of each clause or  provision of this  Agreement  that is
held to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable,  there be added as a part of this
Agreement a clause or provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid, or
unenforceable  clause or provision as may be possible and still be legal, valid,
and enforceable.

6.08  Attorneys   Fees.  The  prevailing   party  in  any   litigation,
arbitration  or  other  proceedings  arising  out of  this  Agreement  shall  be
reimbursed  by the  other  party for all costs  and  expenses  incurred  in such
proceedings, including reasonable attorneys' fees.

6.09  Force  Majeure.  No party  hereto  shall be  liable  for delay or
default in performing hereunder, other than a delay or default in payment of any
monies due to the other party, if such  performance is delayed or prevented by a
Force Majeure Condition.  ""Force Majeure Condition"" means any condition or event
beyond the reasonable  control of the party affected  thereby,  including  fire,
explosion,  or other  casualty,  act of God, war or civil  disturbance,  acts of

acts  of  city,  state,  local  or  federal   governments  in  their  sovereign,
regulatory,  or  contractual  capacity,  labor  difficulties,  and strikes,  but
specifically  excluding a party's failure to be Year 2000 Compliant.  If a Force
Majeure  Condition  occurs,  the party  delayed or unable to perform  shall give
prompt notice of such  occurrence to the other party.  The party affected by the
other party's inability to perform,  may, after sixty (60) days, elect to either
terminate  this Agreement or continue  performance  with the option of extending
the terms of the Agreement up to the length of time the Force Majeure  Condition
endures.  The party  experiencing  the Force Majeure  Condition  must inform the
other party in writing when such a condition ceases to exist.  Each party shall,
with the cooperation of the other,  exercise all reasonable  efforts to mitigate
the extent of a delay or failure resulting from a Force Majeure Condition.

6.10   Independent   Contractor.   The   relationship  of  the  parties
established by this Agreement is that of  independent  contractors,  and nothing
contained in this Agreement will be construed (a) to give either party the power

to direct and control the day-to-day  activities of the other, (b) to constitute
the parties as partners, joint venturers, owners or otherwise as participants in
a joint or common undertaking,  or (c) to allow either party to create or assume
any obligation on behalf of the other for any purpose whatsoever.

appropriate confidentiality or nondisclosure agreements.

5.  GOVERNMENT END USERS
U.S.  GOVERNMENT  RESTRICTED RIGHTS. The System was developed at private expense
and with no government funds. If any Software or Documentation is acquired by or
on behalf of a unit or agency of the U.S. Government, the Government agrees that
such Software or Documentation is ""commercial  computer software"" or ""commercial
computer  software  documentation""  and that,  absent a written agreement to the

6.  WARRANTY
(a) Licensor  warrants solely to you that the System will function in accordance
with  Avid's  published  specifications  for  the  period(s)  set  forth  in the
applicable warranty policy in effect at the time of purchase. This warranty does
not apply to  expendable  components,  such as,  but not  limited  to,  computer
diskettes and tapes.  Licensor does not warrant that your use of the System will
be uninterrupted or error-free.

(b) If Licensor determines that the System, or the component parts thereof,  for
which you have requested warranty service are not eligible for warranty service,
you will pay or reimburse Licensor for all reasonable costs of investigating and
responding  to such request at  Licensor's  then  prevailing  time and materials
rates.  If Licensor  provides  repair service or replacement  parts that are not
covered by the  warranty  provided  in this  Section,  you will pay  Licensor at

external to the System such as, but not  limited to,  power  failure or electric
power surges, or (v) use of the System in combination with equipment or software
not supplied or approved by Avid.

(d)  Notwithstanding the above, no warranty shall apply to Hardware and Software
which is designated as ""limited  release"" or  ""pre-release""  or otherwise as not

on 30 days'  notice.  In the  event  you  purchase  Software  maintenance,  such
maintenance  shall be subject to the terms and conditions  effective on the date
of such purchase,  and Avid shall provide the following,  plus options,  if any,
which you purchase, effective immediately upon expiry of the applicable warranty
period.

(a) You will  receive  one copy of  maintenance  releases  to the  Software  and
Documentation  as they are generally made  available at no additional  charge to
Avid  customers  which have  purchased  Avid software  maintenance.  Maintenance
releases may contain minor functional enhancements and corrections.

(b) Avid will use  reasonable  efforts,  including by means of a  workaround  or
telephone hot-line support,  to cause Software not covered by Avid's warranty to

notified by you of non-performance.

(c)  Avid  will  provide  maintenance  only on the  then  most  current  and one
immediately  prior  version  of  the  Software.  Avid's  obligation  to  provide
maintenance shall be conditioned on your: using only Avid-approved  products and
maintaining the correct  operating  environment in accordance with  requirements
stipulated in the  applicable  System  specifications;  designating  one of your
employees at each site to be Avid's  single  service  contact and allowing  Avid
reasonable  access to the System and necessary  data;  promptly  installing  all
changes  and/or  updates  furnished by or on behalf of Avid;  notifying  Avid in
writing prior to relocating  the System to a permitted  location  other than the

8.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
THE MAXIMUM LIABILITY OF LICENSOR AND/OR AVID (AND ITS LICENSORS) ARISING OUT OF
THE  SALE/LICENSE  OF THE  SYSTEM  OR  THE  USE  THEREOF  OR  THE  PROVISION  OF
MAINTENANCE, WHETHER BASED UPON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, SHALL NOT
EXCEED THE ACTUAL PAYMENTS RECEIVED BY IT.

9.  EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES
IN NO EVENT  SHALL  LICENSOR  AND/OR  AVID (AND ITS  LICENSORS)  BE  LIABLE  FOR
SPECIAL,  INCIDENTAL,  PUNITIVE,  INDIRECT,  ECONOMIC OR CONSEQUENTIAL  DAMAGES,
INCLUDING,  BUT NOT LIMITED  TO, LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF USE DAMAGES  (INCLUDING
WITHOUT LIMITATION  ""DOWNTIME"") AND LOST PROFITS,  ARISING HEREUNDER OR FROM THE
SALE OF SYSTEM OR THE LICENSE OF THE  SOFTWARE AND  DOCUMENTATION  OR THE USE OF
ANY OF THEM OR THE PROVISION OF MAINTENANCE.

10. TERM
This license is effective until terminated. You may terminate the license at any
time by returning the Software and all Documentation to Licensor and by removing
the Software and all copies  thereof from the memory of any computer  into which
the Software has been  transferred.  If you fail to perform any of your material
obligations hereunder, Licensor will offer you 15 days' opportunity to cure such
nonperformance.  Upon expiry of such period  without  the  nonperformance  being
cured,  Licensor may by  immediate  written  notice  terminate  this  Agreement,
including the license of the Software and the  Documentation.  Within seven days
of Licensor's  termination  of this  Agreement,  you will return to Licensor the
original and all copies of the Software and the Documentation.  Any Software you
are  required  to return  hereunder  includes  circuit  boards  containing  Avid
proprietary software, firmware or other technology.

11. EXPORT
You agree that neither the Software nor any direct  product  thereof is being or
will be shipped,  transferred  or reexported,  directly or indirectly,  into any
country  prohibited  by the  United  States  Export  Administration  Act and the
regulations thereunder or will be used for any purposes prohibited by the Act.

12. GENERAL
(a) If Avid is not the Licensor  under this  Agreement,  the parties  agree that
Avid is an intended  third party  beneficiary  of this Agreement and may enforce
the provisions hereof.

(b) This Agreement  supersedes all prior agreements and  understandings  between
the parties  related to the subject matter herein and is intended by the parties
to be the complete and exclusive statement of the terms of their Agreement.  Any
proposed  variations  from or  additions  to  this  Agreement  contained  in any
purchase order or other  communication which you submit to Licensor will be null
and  void  unless  agreed  to in  writing  by an  authorized  representative  of
Licensor.

(c) The remedies  contained  herein are  cumulative and in addition to any other
remedies at law or equity.  Licensor's failure to enforce, or waiver of a breach
of, any  provision  hereof shall not  constitute a waiver of any other breach of
such provision.  You acknowledge  that a breach by you of Section 2 or 4 of this
Agreement would  constitute  irreparable  harm to Avid for which a remedy at law
would be inadequate and therefore consent to being enjoined from any such breach
without requiring Licensor or Avid to post a bond.

(d)  Licensor  shall  not  be  considered  in  default  in  performance  of  its
obligations hereunder if performance of such obligations is prevented or delayed
by  acts  of God or  government,  war,  riots,  acts of  civil  disorder,  labor
disputes,  failure  or  delay of  transportation  or  telecommunications,  or by
vendors  or  subcontractors,  or any other  similar  cause or causes  beyond its
reasonable control.

(e) The terms and conditions of this Agreement will be held as  confidential  by
both parties hereto, provided, however, that Licensor and Avid may cite that you
are a user of the System.

(f) The System is manufactured for standard commercial uses and are not intended
to be sold or licensed for use in critical safety systems or nuclear facilities.

(g)  This  Agreement  shall  be  governed  by the  laws of the  Commonwealth  of
Massachusetts, U.S.A., without regard to conflict of laws rules that would cause
the laws of any other jurisdiction to apply.

Copyright  (C)  1998,  Avid  Technology,  Inc.  and its  licensors.  All  rights
reserved.

time from input to producing a response). ACSC agrees that when Greate Bay
reports an Error, ACSC will immediately commence work on an Error Correction and
provide an Error Correction (i) as soon as reasonably possible if no
commercially acceptable workaround is available to Great Bay or (ii) within a
reasonable period of time if a commercially acceptable workaround is available

components directly from such suppliers absent a default by ACSC of its
obligations under this Paragraph 6.

(f) Equitable Remedies.  The obligations of ACSC in this Paragraph 6
shall be specifically enforceable and ACSC agrees that (i) any breach of ACSC's
obligations under this Paragraph 6 would cause irreparable injury to Greate Bay;
(ii) Greate Bay would have an inadequate remedy at law for any such breach;
(iii) the balance of interests and hardships would favor an injunction in favor
of Greate Bay; (iv) the public interest would favor an injunction in favor of
Greate Bay, and (v) ACSC will make no legal arguments that equitable relief is
not an appropriate remedy in favor of Greate Bay in the event of a breach of
ACSC's obligations under this Paragraph.

7.   ESCROW OF THE ""COLLECTOR"" LOGIC BOARD SOURCE CODE.  The Escrow Agent
for the Source Code for the operating system of the ""Collector"" Logic Board

acknowledge receipt of the Source Code and shall keep same in a safe secure
location.  Except as set forth below, the Escrow Agent shall not allow or permit
any party or third party to have access to, copies of or information concerning
the Source Code held in escrow.  Upon receipt of written certification

<PAGE>

from Greate Bay's Vice President-MIS that ACSC has either ceased doing business
and there is no successor in interest that has assumed the obligations of ACSC
or that ACSC is in default of its obligations under this Agreement, the Escrow

of allowing Greate Bay to provide itself with support services and to effect the
repair, replacement, maintenance and/or debugging of the ""Collector"" Logic Board
as determined by Greate Bay.

8.   INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY WARRANTIES.  INDEMNIFICATION.  ACSC represents
and warrants that ACSC knows of no fact, circumstance or claim that the exercise
of rights pursuant to this Agreement would infringe any valid and subsisting
intellectual property right owned by any other persons.  Greate Bay acknowledges
and understands that Greate Bay must obtain licenses for the serial or other
protocols from the respective game manufacturers necessary to interface the
Software and the SMS with the games of each manufacturer.  ACSC will defend at
its expense or settle at its option, any action brought against Greate Bay to
the extent that it is based on a claim that the Software, the SMS Hardware or
the SMS Software or the Configuration, as used within the scope of this
Agreement, infringes any copyright or United States patent.  ACSC will pay any
attorneys' fees, costs and damages awarded against or incurred by Greate Bay in
such actions which are attributable to such claim provided that Greate Bay
notifies ACSC in writing of the claim within five (5) calendar days of the
service or other notification of such claim upon Greate Bay and ACSC fully
controls the defense and settlement of such claims.  Should the Software or the
SMS or the SMS Software or the Configuration become, or, in ACSC's opinion, be
likely to become the subject of a claim of infringement of a copyright or
patent, ACSC may procure for Greate Bay the right to continue using the
Software, the SMS or the SMS Software or the Configuration or replace or modify
the Software, the SMS or the SMS Software or the Configuration to make it non-
infringing, provided that no such replacement or modification shall decrease or
adversely change the performance of the Software or SMS or the Configuration and
further provided that no such replacement or modification shall cause Error.
ACSC shall have no liability for any claim of copyright or patent infringement
based on the use or combination of the Software, the SMS, SMS Software or the
Configuration with programs or data not supplied by ACSC.  Any indemnity
provided herein shall not exceed and shall expressly be limited to Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00).

how or expertise, (collectively, the ""Confidential Information""), will be deemed
confidential/proprietary information of ACSC.  Greate Bay agrees that it shall

application of the Software or the SMS, but only after such independent
consultant or consulting group has executed a written confidentiality agreement
pursuant to which it covenants to not use the Confidential Information except
for Greate Bay as permitted herein and to not

<PAGE>

disclose the Confidential Information under the same conditions of
confidentiality contained herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Greate Bay may

connection with Greate Bay's rights or the performance of obligations under this
Agreement. All such personnel will be instructed by Greate Bay that the
Confidential Information is subject to the obligation of confidentiality set
forth by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Greate Bay may disclose
Confidential Information to an entity that is not a competitor of ACSC and is
offering (i) a Plan of Reorganization in the Chapter 11 Proceeding or (ii) to
purchase control of Greate Bay, provided however, that any such entity shall
enter into a non-disclosure agreement that requires such entity to protect such
information in the same manner as is required by this Paragraph 10.

Paragraph 10 shall be specifically enforceable and Greate Bay agrees that (i)
any breach of Greate Bay's obligations under this Paragraph 10 would cause
irreparable injury to ACSC; (ii) ACSC would have an inadequate remedy at law for
any such breach; (iii) the balance of interests and hardships would favor an
injunction in favor of ACSC; (iv) the public interest would favor an injunction
in favor of ACSC, and (v) Greate Bay will make no legal arguments that equitable
relief is not an appropriate remedy in favor of ACSC in the event of a breach of
Greate Bay's obligations under this Paragraph.

11.  EXCLUSION OF INCIDENTAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.  NEITHER PARTY WILL
BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY (NOR TO ANY PERSON CLAIMING RIGHTS DERIVED FROM THE
OTHER PARTY'S RIGHTS) FOR INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR
EXEMPLARY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, including lost profits or revenue, loss of
business, or other economic damage, and further including injury to property, AS
A RESULT OF BREACH OF ANY WARRANTY OR OTHER TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS
OF WHETHER THE PARTY LIABLE OR ALLEGEDLY LIABLE WAS ADVISED OR HAD OTHER REASON
TO KNOW OR IN FACT KNEW OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.  Independent of, severable
from, and to be enforced independently of any other enforceable or unenforceable
provision of this Agreement, IN NO EVENT SHALL ACSC's AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO
GREATE BAY (INCLUDING TO ANY PERSON OR PERSONS WHOSE CLAIM OR CLAIMS ARE BASED
ON OR DERIVED FROM A RIGHT OR RIGHT CLAIMED BY GREATE BAY), WITH RESPECT TO ANY
AND ALL CLAIMS AT ANY AND ALL TIMES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THE SUBJECT
MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT, IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED ONE MILLION
DOLLARS ($1,000,000.00).

breach of Greate Bay's obligations under this Agreement would cause irreparable
injury to ACSC; (ii) ACSC would have an inadequate remedy at law for any such
breach; (iii) the balance of interests and hardships would favor an injunction
in favor of ACSC; (iv) the public interest would favor an injunction in favor of
ACSC, and (v) Greate Bay will make no legal arguments that equitable relief is
not an appropriate remedy in favor of ACSC in the event of a breach of Greate
Bay's obligations under this Agreement.

13.  ASSIGNMENT.  Greate Bay may not assign any right under this Agreement
and any purported assignment will be null and void and a breach of this
Agreement.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a change of control of
Greate Bay shall not constitute an assignment, and Greate Bay shall have the
right to assign its rights under this Agreement to any person or entity
acquiring substantially all of the assets of Greate Bay or at least 51 percent
of the equity of Greate Bay through purchase, merger, or reorganization and any
such person shall in turn have the right to assign to any other person coming

assign its rights under this Agreement provided that any such assignee shall
expressly assume ACSC's obligations to Greate Bay pursuant to this Agreement and

and other know how such that ACSC can reasonably expect the Assignee to be able
to fulfill the obligations to Greate Bay under this Agreement.

party respectively has full right, power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and the person executing this Agreement on its behalf has actual

CASINO ACCOUNTING AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEM


CASINO MANAGEMENT

The casino management module provides both detailed and summarized
information to executive level, casino management and administration and
pit management.  Through integration of the applications outlined as
follows, management has access to both real time and historical performance
information from a single source (or menu).


TABLE ACCOUNTING & CREDIT

This system integrates all aspects of table games and cage accounting in
addition to patron credit activity.  Additional controls provide automated
and paper less casino credit account review via predefined ""triggers"" and
electronic communications with service providers of casino and credit
bureau information.
<PAGE>

SLOT ACCOUNTING AND MANAGEMENT APPLICATION


SLOT ACCOUNTING & MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
The Slot system is comprised of three modules;
Slot Configuration - allows recording of individual game
specifications and is used to maintain the SMS slot network.  Future
changes to floor configurations may be entered and activated as
required.
Slot Accounting - using the metered information received from SMS,
this module provides complete accounting for all coin, currency and
electronic fund transfers.
Slot Data - provides historical and analytical information regarding
game performance and may be accessed through numerous summary and
detailed selection criteria.
<PAGE>

EXHIBIT ""C""

CASINO PLAYER TRACKING SYSTEM


SUB-SET-RATINGS & COMPLEMENTARIES
This application also performs as the primary information data bank of
information specific to individual patrons gaming activity and
profitability.  Information from both table and slot activity is combined
with the ability to view this information and either combined or
independently.  A complimentary decision process has been incorporated so
that improved customer service may result by removing the requirement for
executive decisions on all issuances.
<PAGE>

EXHIBIT ""D""

CASINO SALES AND MARKETING SYSTEM


ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT

This module provides the ""housekeeping"" functions required to maintain an
accurate data bank of patron information for marketing purposes.  It also
serves to reduce cost specifically for the direct mail marketing
application and purging of inactive patrons.

EXTRACT MANAGEMENT

This is a flexible and robust patron selection module used primarily to
target specific segments of patrons for various marketing and/or analysis
functions.  The results of these extracts may be directed towards numerous
forms of processing.

GROUPS/INVITATION SYSTEM

The primary purpose of the group system is to enable the analysis of
profitability, both actual and potential, for up to twenty (20) user
defined groups or event types.  Expenses and/or complementaries may be
charged direct to a patrons account or as a percentage of theoretical
across all players within the group.  Groups may also include Branch
Offices and Junket Representatives with the ability to compute commissions.
Historical analysis by group type or monthly rep performance is provided.
The invitation module enables the booking of patrons responses to specific
events (i.e. Head liner shows).  Blocking of an event enables analysis
based on invited segment(s).

SWEEPSTAKES SYSTEM

The sweepstakes system provided for the controlling and winner selection
electronically for various promotional sweepstakes.  Entries earned by
patrons are automatically recorded with randomized winner selection based
on event, date and time of day.  If required entries may require pre-
qualification.  Linkage to the direct mail provides for notification of
entries.
<PAGE>

EXHIBIT ""E""

TABLE MARKETING SYSTEM

TABLE MARKETING SYSTEM (TMS)
TMS was developed as an extension of the SMS for table games and utilizes
the same network and controller boards (with function keypads and mark
sense printers).  The primary purposes of TMS consist of: a) control of
complementaries at the table games; b) access to patron information for
ratings, credit and tracking of cash transactions; and c) time and
attendance for pit personnel.
<PAGE>

EXHIBIT ""F""

CASINO ANALYSIS
This system provides the analysis department with information on patrons
gaming history.  Data extraction options allow flexibility in selecting
patron segments for analysis, and an interface to the Group system allows
group analysis.  Data can be interpreted in report format, or downloaded to
a PC for analysis utilizing PC based software, i.e. Foxpro.  Selections
from PC analysis can also be uploaded to the AS/400 to drive the Sales &
Marketing extract system.

MIS RESOURCE REQUEST SYSTEM
The MIS Resource Request system allows the entry and tracking of requests
for maintenance and new requests for Software, Hardware, and other services
provided by MIS.  The system utilizes control files to allow flexibility in
establishing Application areas and allows tracking of the progress of a
request from initial request entry through completion.  For Software
revisions, the system incorporates source and object movement to control
the development/testing cycle and movement to a production environment.
Tracking and reporting of man hours by request is also available.

SECURITY INCIDENT REPORTING SYSTEM
This system provides for the entry of Security Incident data to allow
tracking and reporting of various types of incidents.  Incidents can be
tracked from initiation through closure, and some limited claim/settlement
tracking is provided.

CROSS SYSTEM BACKUP (CSB)
This application is used in a multiple CPU environment to provide a 'hot'
backup capability, for use in the event of a severe hardware failure.  CSB
utilizes the Journaling feature of the AS/400 to capture changes to
designated application system files on a CPU, and transmits the changes to
another CPU, where the CSB application on this CPU applies the changes to
the application files residing on that CPU.

nonetheless be entitled to continue to operate, provide and
offer access to its then in operation Public Exchanges and/or

1.1.	 	Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, THI hereby grants to
Licensee, a worldwide, nontransferable, nonexclusive, nonassignable, limited license

2.1.	 	Licensee’s use of the TIRS Software shall be limited to use to process only
Licensee’s own internal business. Licensee is authorized to make a reasonable number

defined under the Code. The parties agree that Licensee, as licensee of such rights
under this Agreement shall retain and may fully exercise all of its rights and
elections under the Code. The parties further agree that, in the event of the
commencement of any bankruptcy proceeding by or against either party under the Code,
either party shall be entitled to retain all of its rights under this Agreement.

4.	 	TERM AND TERMINATION

4.1.	 	Term of License. Subject to earlier termination as described in
Section 4.2, and unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties, this Agreement
shall commence on the Initial Term Start Date set forth on the Cover Page, and shall
continue until the Initial Term End Date set forth on the Cover Page (such period being
referred to as the “Initial Term”). Thereafter, this Agreement shall automatically
renew for successive renewal terms of one (1) year each (“Renewal Terms”), unless
either party notifies the other of its desire not to renew at least ninety (90) days
prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or Renewal Term then in effect.

4.2.	 	Termination of License. This Agreement may be terminated prior to the
expiration of the Initial Term or any subsequent Renewal Term as follows:






a.	 	Either party may terminate this Agreement at any
time upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the other party if the
other party has breached any of its material obligations and has not
cured such default prior to the expiration of the thirty (30) day period.
In addition, either party will have the right to terminate this
Agreement upon thirty (30) days prior written notice if a Force Majeure
Condition (as defined in Section 12.4) has prevented performance by the
other party for more than one hundred twenty (120) consecutive days.

b.	 	Either party may terminate this Agreement at any
time upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the other party if a
court or other governmental entity issues an order that requires THI to
materially alter the TIRS Software or otherwise materially restricts or
limits THI’s ability to deliver or license the TIRS Software as it exists
as of the Effective Date of this Agreement.





TIRS/AWAC License Agreement

Page 4 of 15





















c.	 	THI may terminate this Agreement at any time upon
written notice to Licensee if any assignment is made by Licensee for the
benefit of creditors, or if a receiver, trustee in bankruptcy or similar
officer shall be appointed to take charge of any or all of Licensee’s
property, or if Licensee files a voluntary petition under federal
bankruptcy laws or similar state or foreign statutes or such a petition
is filed against Licensee and is not dismissed within forty-five (45)
days, or if Licensee liquidates or otherwise winds up its business for
any reason.

d.	 	THI may terminate this Agreement if a third party
acquires Licensee, if Licensee merges with a third party, or if any
entity that did not have a majority ownership interest in Licensee as of
the Effective Date subsequently acquires a majority ownership interest in
Licensee, by providing twelve months written notice to Licensee of such
termination, following THI’s actual knowledge of such change in control
of Licensee.






4.3.	 	The parties agree that unauthorized use, disclosure or transfer of the TIRS
Software may substantially diminish the value of such materials and irreparably harm
THI, and therefore further agree that THI shall be entitled to injunctive and/or other
equitable relief, in addition to other remedies afforded by law, to prevent or restrain
a breach of this Agreement.

4.4.	 	Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement, Licensee shall
immediately return to THI (or, at THI’s option, destroy and certify in writing to THI
that it has destroyed) the original and all copies of the TIRS Software, including
compilations, translations, partial copies, archival copies, upgrades, updates, release
notes and training materials relating to the TIRS Software, and all security devices,
if any, and media on which original copies of the TIRS Software are contained. If
Licensee fails to return or destroy any such materials, it shall continue to pay all
License Fees until such return or destruction, notwithstanding the termination of the
License.

5.	 	LICENSE FEES

5.1.	 	Initial License Term. The Licensee shall pay THI the License Fee
according to the schedule set forth on the Cover Page. Licensee’s failure to make such
payments according to this schedule shall be considered a material breach of its
obligations under this Agreement.

5.2.	 	Renewal Terms. THI reserves the right to modify these terms and
conditions by providing notice to Licensee of the new terms and conditions as provided
herein. The terms and conditions for each Renewal Term, except for pricing, shall be

the proposed changes 90 days prior to the beginning of the pertinent Renewal Term. THI
shall also notify Licensee 90 days prior to the beginning of the renewal term of





TIRS/AWAC License Agreement

Page 5 of 15

beginning of each Renewal Term, Licensee shall notify THI of its intent to renew or
terminate this Agreement. If Licensee elects to renew, Licensee shall pay THI the
entire renewal License Fee concurrently with its notice of election to renew.
Licensee shall be obligated to pay the entire renewal License Fee for any Renewal
Term that has commenced, regardless of the level of Licensee’s actual or expected use
of the TIRS Software during such Renewal Term.

5.3.	 	Payments Net. All payments, fees and other charges payable by Licensee
to THI under this Agreement are net of all freight charges, taxes (including sales,
value-added or use taxes), tariffs and other governmental charges, all of which shall
be paid by Licensee. Licensee acknowledges that it is responsible for such
governmental charges and that if THI is required to pay any such charges based on the
TIRS Software, services or other items provided to Licensee, then such charges, but not
any penalties or interest, shall be billed to and paid by Licensee. Licensee shall
obtain and provide to THI any certificate of exemption or similar document required to
exempt any transaction under this Agreement from sales tax, use tax or other tax
liability.

5.4.	 	Payment Terms. All payments shall be made in U.S. Dollars.

5.5.	 	Effect of Early Termination. In the event that this License Agreement

Term.

and to the TIRS Software and all modifications, updates, upgrades and enhancements
thereto (including ownership of all trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, service
marks, and patentable inventions pertaining thereto), subject only to the rights and
privileges expressly granted to you herein by THI. This Agreement does not provide
Licensee with title or ownership of the TIRS Software, but only a right of limited use
as provided herein. Licensee shall keep the licensed TIRS Software free and clear of
all claims, liens, and encumbrances.

6.2.	 	This Agreement shall not be construed as an encumbrance or limitation of any
kind on THI’s right to develop or modify the TIRS Software in any way. In addition,
this Agreement shall not be construed as an encumbrance or limitation of any kind on
THI’s right to transfer ownership of the TIRS Software or to license or sublicense the
TIRS Software to any party, provided that the rights granted to Licensee in this
Agreement shall remain in effect for the Initial Term and any subsequent Renewal Term.





TIRS/AWAC License Agreement

6.3.	 	Licensee understands and agrees that THI considers the TIRS Software, Third
Party Software (as defined in Section 8.1), associated documentation, and all
modifications, updates, upgrades and enhancements thereto (including ownership of all
trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, and patentable inventions
pertaining thereto this Agreement (collectively “THI Confidential Information”), as
between THI and Licensee, to be the proprietary and confidential information of THI.
Licensee agrees to maintain the THI Confidential Information in confidence and, except
for the right of Licensee to make copies of the TIRS Software for the purposes
authorized in Section 2.1 above, Licensee agrees not to disclose, duplicate or
otherwise reproduce, directly or indirectly, the THI Confidential Information in whole
or in part. Licensee may disclose THI Confidential Information to consultants retained
by Licensee to the extent reasonably necessary solely for such consultants to assist
Licensee in the permitted use of the TIRS Software and provided Licensee obligates such
consultant to protect the confidentiality of the THI Confidential Information as
contained herein.

6.4.	 	Licensee agrees that neither it nor anyone acting on its behalf, including
Licensee’s officers, directors, employees, agents, or any person or party acting at the
request of Licensee, shall disassemble, reverse engineer, or reverse compile the TIRS
Software in whole or in part. Licensee agrees to take reasonable steps to ensure that
no unauthorized persons shall have access to the THI Confidential Information and that
all authorized persons having access to the THI Confidential Information shall refrain
from any such disclosure, duplication or reproduction. Licensee agrees not to remove
any copyright notice or other proprietary markings from the THI Confidential
Information, and any copy thereof made by Licensee for backup purposes shall contain
the same copyright notice and proprietary markings contained on the copy of the TIRS
Software furnished by THI to Licensee hereunder.

6.5.	 	If the THI Confidential Information will be provided or made available to the
U.S. Government, any use, duplication, or disclosure by the U.S. Government of the THI
Confidential Information shall be subject to the restrictions applicable to proprietary
commercial computer software set forth in subparagraph (c)(1)(ii) of the Rights in
Technical Data and Computer Software clause at DFARS 252.227-7013 or subparagraphs
(c)(1) and (2) of the Commercial Computer Software — Restricted Rights clause at 48 CFR
52.227-19, as applicable.

6.6.	 	During its performance of this Agreement, THI may be supplied with or have
access to written, tangible, oral or visual “Licensee Confidential Information,” as
defined below. THI shall maintain the Licensee Confidential Information in confidence,
in a manner no less restrictive than it would use to maintain its own confidential
information (in no case using less than a reasonable duty of care), and use Licensee
Confidential Information solely for the purpose of THI performing its obligations under
this Agreement and shall obligate its employees and permitted subcontractors to make no
other use of such Licensee Confidential Information. THI and its





TIRS/AWAC License Agreement

Page 7 of 15





















employees and permitted subcontractors shall not disclose such Licensee Confidential
Information to any third party, without Licensee’s express written consent. “Licensee
Confidential Information” shall mean all information concerning Licensee’s business
affairs, property, methods of operation, processing systems or other information, in
tangible, oral or visual information received by THI while on the premises of
Licensee, or otherwise, and which THI personnel are likely to recognize as
information which Licensee considers to be confidential and which Licensee takes
reasonable precautions to protect from unauthorized use or disclosure.

6.7.	 	Each party acknowledges that its failure to comply with the provisions of this
Section 6 may result in irreparable harm to the other for which a remedy at law may be
inadequate, and therefore, in the event of breach or threatened breach by the recipient
of information protected by this Section, the other party shall be entitled to seek
equitable relief in the form of specific performance and/or an injunction for any such
actual or threatened breach, in addition to the exercise of any other remedies at law
and in equity.

6.8.	 	The confidentiality obligations in this Section shall not apply to information
disclosed hereunder which:






a.	 	was previously known to recipient;

b.	 	is or becomes generally available to the public
through no fault of the recipient;

c.	 	is developed by or on behalf of the recipient
independent of any information furnished under this Agreement; or

d.	 	is received by recipient from a third party as a
matter of right.






Provided, however, if THI, with respect to Licensee Confidential Information, or
Licensee, with respect to THI Confidential Information, is required to disclose such
information by law or by any governmental agency having jurisdiction pursuant to an
order to produce or in the course of a legal proceeding pursuant to a lawful request
for discovery, then, THI or Licensee, as applicable, shall utilize reasonable efforts
to promptly notify the other of the order or request in discovery and reasonably
cooperate with Licensee or THI, as applicable, if the other elects (at its expense)
to seek to limit or avoid such disclosure by any lawful means.

6.9.	 	Licensee agrees that the TIRS Software is the intellectual property of THI.
Licensee agrees not to directly or indirectly, register, apply for registration or
attempt to acquire any legal protection for any of the TIRS Software or any proprietary
rights therein.

6.10.	 	Licensee agrees to utilize reasonable efforts to notify THI immediately and in
writing of all circumstances surrounding the unauthorized possession or use of the TIRS
Software and associated documentation by any person or entity of which Licensee may
become aware. Licensee agrees to cooperate with THI in any litigation relating to or
arising from such unauthorized possession or use.

6.11.	 	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the obligations set
forth in this Section 6 will survive the termination of this Agreement for any reason.
However, the confidentiality obligations set forth in this Section 6 will terminate 5
years after the expiration or termination of this Agreement.

7.	 	WARRANTIES

7.1.	 	THI warrants that for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of

due and owing to THI under this Agreement. THI does not warrant that TIRS Software will
operate uninterrupted or error free, that the functions contained in the TIRS Software
will operate in combination with other software or hardware selected by Licensee, or
that the TIRS Software will meet Licensee’s requirements.

herein, or to require the performance by the other party hereto of any provisions of
this Agreement or the waiver by either party of any breach of this Agreement, will not

that the Software and Documentation under escrow will be released to Novartis in the Event of Bankruptcy of CombinatoRx and as otherwise mutually agreed by CombinatoRx and Novartis. Fees charged by the Escrow Agent shall be paid by Novartis.





9.	CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-DISCLOSURE:



(A)	Software and Documentation

Novartis acknowledges
that the Software and Documentation are proprietary products of and shall remain the property of CombinatoRx or its suppliers. Novartis and its Affiliates will not disclose or otherwise make available to any third party any Software, Documentation,
or information contained therein, in any form, except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement. Novartis and its Affiliates shall take appropriate action by instruction or signed agreements with their employees and independent contractors to
satisfy their obligations under this Section.

If for any
reason CombinatoRx gains access to Novartis’ or its Affiliates’ confidential or proprietary information, technology or know-how, to which CombinatoRx does not have a right of access under the Collaboration Agreement or another written
agreement, CombinatoRx agrees to not examine, use, copy, disclose or keep such confidential or proprietary information, technology or know-how, but to return them promptly to Novartis. CombinatoRx’s obligations of confidentiality and
nondisclosure shall apply to all forms of confidential information, technology or know-how received in any manner. For further clarity, all information, technology and know-how obtained by CombinatoRx and its employees and independent contractors
while on Novartis’ or its Affiliates’ premises (whether via disclosure by Novartis or its Affiliates, unintentionally or otherwise) shall be considered confidential and proprietary under this Section. CombinatoRx shall take appropriate
action by instruction or signed agreements with its employees and independent contractors to satisfy CombinatoRx’s obligations under this Section.

or terms of this Agreement or make any press release or other public communication relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein without the prior written consent of the non-disclosing party, such consent to be in the sole
discretion of such non-disclosing party, except as may be required by applicable laws, regulations, or judicial order. Notwithstanding the foregoing, publications describing results obtained using the Software are permitted to reference the method
by which such results were obtained, and are permitted to acknowledge CombinatoRx and the name of the Software.


3









(D)	Injunctive Relief

Because harm not adequately
compensable by monetary damages might result from unauthorized disclosure of proprietary or confidential information, either party may seek injunctive relief, without posting a bond, if the other party breaches its obligations of confidentiality and
nondisclosure under this Agreement.
The provisions of this Section 9 shall survive for a period of five (5) years following the
termination or expiration of this Agreement.


10.	INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT: CombinatoRx will defend, indemnify and hold Novartis and its Affiliates harmless against any and all third party claims (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) that the Software or Documentation, or any part thereof, infringes any patent, copyright, or trade secret worldwide. If the use of the Software or the Documentation, or any part thereof is enjoined,
CombinatoRx will, at its own expense and at its option, either (A) procure the right to continue using the Software or the infringing part thereof; (B) replace same with non-infringing substitutes; (C) modify the Software so that it
becomes noninfringing; or (D) if CombinatoRx finds no commercially reasonable solution under (A), (B), or (C) above, terminate the License. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if CombinatoRx performs any of choice (A), (B) or (C) for
itself, it shall do the same for Novartis and its Affiliates.

The foregoing states the entire liability of CombinatoRx with
respect to infringements of patents, copyrights, or trade secrets by the Software or Documentation.
Parts of the Software or Documentation
may have been patented or copyrighted by CombinatoRx or its third-party providers. Patent or copyright notices may have been included in the Software and Documentation for protective purposes, and such notices shall not be construed as causing
publication of the Software or Documentation.

License pursuant to Section 2 of this Agreement. CombinatoRx represents and warrants that upon download or receipt, the Software, the Documentation and any updates will not contain any virus, worm, Trojan horse or other malicious or potentially
harmful code.

Neither CombinatoRx nor any of its third party suppliers otherwise warrants or guarantees the performance of
the Software or the results obtained from use of the Software.

AND ARE IN LIEU OF ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A





4










PARTICULAR PURPOSE. COMBINATORX WILL NOT BE LIABLE IN ANY EVENT FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE OR ITS USE.




13.	TERM AND TERMINATION: The term of this Agreement shall be five (5) years, six (6) weeks from the Effective Date (the “Initial Term”), unless
extended pursuant to this Section or earlier terminated as set forth in the following paragraph. Novartis may, in its sole discretion, extend the Term of this Agreement for three (3) additional five (5) year periods (each, a
“Subsequent Term”) pursuant to written notice provided to CombinatoRx, in each case, no later than thirty (30) days prior to the end of the Initial Term or current Subsequent Term, as applicable. Collectively, the Initial Term and any
Subsequent Terms shall constitute the “Term.”

This agreement may be terminated prior to the end of the Term as
follows:


(A)	by Novartis at any time for any reason or no reason upon written notice;



(B)	by mutual written consent of Novartis and CombinatoRx;



(C)	by CombinatoRx pursuant to Section 10(D); or



(D)	by CombinatoRx in the event of a default or breach by Novartis of any material term or condition of this Agreement, provided that CombinatoRx has sent written notice of such default
or breach to Novartis, and provided, further, that Novartis has not cured such default or breach within sixty (60) days of Novartis’ receipt of such notice.

Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, Novartis and its Affiliates shall promptly uninstall and return to CombinatoRx all copies of the
Software and Documentation in their possession or certify in writing to CombinatoRx that all such copies have been destroyed. CombinatoRx shall provide reasonable assistance to Novartis, as required under the circumstances, to uninstall and destroy
the Software and Documentation. Termination or expiration of this Agreement shall not terminate, constitute a breach of, or otherwise affect the Collaboration Agreement.


14.	 ASSIGNMENT: This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto. Neither
party may assign this Agreement without the written consent of the other, and any such attempted assignment shall be null, void and of no effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Novartis may assign this Agreement to an Affiliate of Novartis without
the prior written consent of CombinatoRx. “Affiliate” shall mean any person who directly or indirectly controls or is controlled by or is under common control with a party to this Agreement. For purposes of this definition,
“control,” “controls” or “controlled” means ownership directly or through one or more Affiliates, of fifty percent (50%) or more of the shares of stock entitled to vote for the election of directors, in the case of
a corporation, or fifty percent (50%) or more of the equity interest in the case of any other type of legal entity, status as a general partner in any partnership, or any other





5










arrangement whereby a party controls or has the right to control the board of directors or equivalent governing body of a corporation or other entity, or the
ability to cause the direction of the management or policies of a corporation or other entity. The parties acknowledge that in the case of certain entities organized under the laws of certain countries outside of the United States, the maximum
percentage ownership permitted by law for a foreign investor may be less than fifty percent (50%), and that in such case such lower percentage shall be substituted in the preceding sentence, provided that such foreign investor has the power
to direct the management and policies of such entity. In the case of Novartis, “Affiliates” shall also expressly be deemed to include the Novartis Institute for Functional Genomics, Inc. (also known as the Genomics Institute of the
Novartis Research Foundation), the Friedrich Miescher Institute for BioMedical Research and their respective Affiliates.




15.	NOTICES: Notices under this Agreement shall be in writing, will be effective when received, and shall be sent to the address designated in the first paragraph of this
Agreement or such other address as may have been furnished to the other party by prior written notice according to this Section.



16.	GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE: This Agreement and any dispute arising from the performance or breach of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without reference to conflicts of laws principles. The Parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the state and federal courts located in Suffolk County,
Massachusetts. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement. In the event the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) or any similar federal or state laws or
regulations are enacted, they will not apply to this Agreement, and the governing law will remain as if such laws or regulations had not been enacted.



17.	SEVERABILITY: If any provision of this Agreement shall be judged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited
to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in effect.



18.	INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS: The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors. There is no relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise or
agency created hereby between the parties. Neither party will have the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other party’s behalf.

20.	ENTIRE AGREEMENT: This Agreement (including its annexes), together with the Collaboration Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, constitute the entire agreement between
Novartis and CombinatoRx regarding the Software and Documentation and supersede all prior oral and written statements of any kind whatsoever made by either party or their representatives. Any waivers or amendments, to be effective, must be in
writing, signed by both parties. The failure of either party to exercise or enforce any right conferred upon it under this Agreement will not be deemed to be a waiver of such right nor operate to bar the enforcement thereof at any time or times
thereafter.

registered office at c/o Abacus Financial Services (Mauritius) Limited, Third Floor, TM Building, Pope Hennessy Street, Port Louis, Republic of Mauritius (hereinafter referred to as “Licensor”) and KNOWLEDGEWORKS GLOBAL
PRIVATE LIMITED, a company incorporated in India under the Companies Act, 1956 having its registered office at Knowledge Centre, Street No. 17, MIDC, Andheri (East), Mumbai 400 093, India (hereinafter referred to as
“Customer”).

Background

A.        Licensor will become the
registered and beneficial owner of eighty percent (80.0%) of the total paid up equity share capital of Customer.

B.        Customer is in the business of providing content management, content processing and other services.


C.        Licensor is
the owner of certain proprietary software and tools more particularly described in Schedule 1 ( hereinafter referred to as the “Software”).

D.        Customer desires to obtain from Licensor, and Licensor agrees to grant to
Customer, a non-exclusive and non-transferable license to use the Software in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and as agreed to by the Licensor and Customer from time-to-time.

Agreement

Accordingly, in consideration of the mutual promises and agreements contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Licensor and Customer agree as follows:

1.      License Grant.    Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensor hereby grants to the Customer a non-exclusive and non-transferable license to use the
Software in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and such other terms as may be agreed to by the Licensor and Customer from time-to-time, for an unlimited number of users and/or concurrent devices and to load and store the said Software
solely for its own business purposes. “Concurrent device “ is each terminal, monitor or input device being used to access network at a given point in time. If multiplexing software or hardware is used, number of concurrent devices must be
measured as the number of terminals, monitors or input devices being used at the multiplexing front end. Customer shall not use the said Software for commercial time sharing, rental or service bureau use involving any person or entity. Except to the
extent needed to use and operate the said Software for its own business purposes, the Customer agrees not to cause or permit reverse engineering, disassembly or de-compilation of the said Software. Customer agrees not to remove any product

3.      Royalty	Payments


(a)        Amount.    In consideration of the license granted herein, Customer will pay
Licensor a royalty (the “Royalty”) equal to (a) two percent (2%) of Customer’s Net Sales of goods and services relating to export sales (but excluding for this purpose any sales to Cadmus Professional Communications or
any other affiliate of Cadmus Communications Corporation), and (b) one percent (1%) of Customer’s Net Sales of goods and services relating to Indian domestic sales; where “Net Sales” means gross sales less
agents’/dealers’ commission, transport cost, including ocean freight, insurance, duties, taxes and other charges, and costs of raw materials, parts, and components imported from a foreign supplier or its subsidiary/affiliated company
provided that in no event shall the Royalty exceed the maximum amount permitted to be paid under applicable law. The parties hereto shall annually review the rate of Royalty set forth hereinabove, no later than 30 days following each anniversary of
this Agreement, during the term, to ensure that the percentage of Royalty payable hereunder reflects at all times the arm’s length value of the rights granted to the Customer under this Agreement. In the event that the parties hereto determine,
by mutual agreement, any change in the percentage of Royalty payable by the Customer under this Agreement then an appropriate amendment to this Agreement shall be executed in writing by the parties hereto to reflect such change in the percentage of
Royalty payable by the Customer to the Licensor under this Agreement.

(b)        Reporting.    Customer will provide Licensor with a monthly statement in a format agreeable to Licensor, itemizing the Royalty payable, within 30 days following
the end of each month. In addition this monthly statement shall also include the rate at which tax will be deducted at source on the Royalty payable and the amount of such deduction. Each monthly report will be accompanied by a statement signed by
an authorised officer of Customer certifying that the report is accurate, correct and complete and prepared in compliance with this Agreement.

(c)        Payment.    Customer and Licensor will agree from time-to-time during the
term of this Agreement upon appropriate procedures, mechanics and timing for payment of the Royalty by Customer to Licensor. For example, but without limitation, Customer could pay the Royalty to Licensor contemporaneously with each statement; or
Customer could pay the Royalty to Licensor periodically when Licensor’s Board of Directors meet to agree upon final arrangements for settlement of intercompany receivables; or Customer and Licensor could agree upon any other procedure that is
mutually satisfactory to them. Time is of the essence with respect to all royalty payments made hereunder. It is understood between the parties hereto that all payments due and payable under this Agreement shall be made by the Customer, to the
Licensor, subject to deduction of tax at source, as applicable under Indian laws and any such deduction shall not increase the amount of Royalty that the Customer is obliged to pay under this Agreement as set forth in Section 3(a). If Customer
defaults or fails to make payment when such obligation is due in accordance with their aforesaid agreement, Customer will pay Licensor interest on such past-due amount at the rate of 1.5% per month from the date such payment was due until such
payment is received by Licensor, and for this purpose Customer will obtain all such approvals as may be required in order to enable Customer to pay the amount of interest to Licensor. All payments due and payable hereunder will be made by Customer
in United States Dollars or such other currency as Customer and Licensor may mutually agree.

(d)        Books and Records.    Customer will keep accurate books of account and records at its principal place of business covering all transactions
relating to this Agreement, for at least three years after the payment of the corresponding Royalty, and Licensor will have the right, at all reasonable hours of the day, to audit Customer’s books of account and records on five days’ prior
notice.

Greate Bay's initial filing of a petition in the Chapter 11 Proceeding (""Post
Petition"") within 45 days of receipt of an invoice therefor and less any sums

Commencing with the date a Plan of Reorganization in the Chapter 11 Proceeding

Proceeding approving a sale by Greate Bay of substantially all its assets, ACSC
agrees, for so long as ACSC provides such services to third parties or any of
its affiliates, to provide the materials and updates, as hereinafter described

hereafter defined in paragraph 6(d), and the supplier lists described in
Paragraph 6(e) and such other services as may now or hereafter be provided by
ACSC to Greate Bay or affiliates or third parties as may be requested by Greate

1997 by and between Logical Solutions International, Inc. and Caesars World,
Inc. (the ""Caesars Agreement"") without regard to quantity and volume discounts

<PAGE>

upon the signing of this Agreement to the extent Greate Bay is not in
possession, ACSC shall provide Greate Bay with all basic materials,
documentation manuals in printed and magnetic format, source codes, including
but not limited to the source code for all systems and application programs
running on the AS/400 and in the ""HASS"" file servers, the ""Gearbox"" PC's, the

Software, and other documentation integral to the SMS Protocol or to the source
codes or otherwise delineating and explaining the structure, organization,

Source Code will be provided in the highest form that allows modification.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Source Code for the Operating System of the
""Collector"" Logic Board shall be placed in Escrow as provided in Paragraph 7 of
this Agreement.  During the term of this Agreement, ACSC shall make available to
Greate Bay upon their completion copies of all modifications, improvements, or
updates (""Updates"") to the Software and/or the SMS at the same time or prior to
the date on which ACSC makes such updates available to other customers of ACSC,
and shall further provide Greate Bay no later than 10 days after request by
Greate Bay, with copies of the Source Code for such Updates and revised copies
of the Source Code for the entire Software and SMS which includes the Source
Code for such Updates.  Greate Bay shall have the right within the Licensed
Facilities or at other locations authorized under this Agreement to full and
unfettered use of the Source Code and may permanently install and maintain the
Source Code in its computer system for its own internal use.

(d) Provision of Hardware and Maintenance and Support Services.
During the term of this Agreement and as may be requested by Greate Bay from
time to time, ACSC shall provide Greate Bay, with SMS Hardware Components and
Support Services for Software and SMS. Support Services means providing Updates,
Required Additions and/or Changes (as defined below), providing Error

communication between the Software and/or SMS and other systems covered by this
Agreement or as may be mutually agreed upon the parties, providing telephone
support and providing programming and project management services and such other
services as may be required via telephone and at Licensed Facilities to install,
integrate, maintain and support the Software and SMS. The term Required
Additions and/or Changes means all changes and additions that must be made to
Software and/or SMS to keep it in compliance with statutory,

<PAGE>

regulatory, and accounting practices changes. The term Error Correction means a
modification, change or improvement to the Software or SMS that corrects an
Error (as defined below). The term Error means a defect, deficiency or other
problem with the Software or SMS that causes the Software or SMS to fail to
operate in accordance with the documentation for the Software or SMS, to produce
incorrect results, to damage data, to incorrectly store, retrieve, sort, present
or calculate data, or to have a commercially unacceptable response time (i.e.
time from input to producing a response). ACSC agrees that when Greate Bay
reports an Error, ACSC will immediately commence work on an Error Correction and
provide an Error Correction (i) as soon as reasonably possible if no
commercially acceptable workaround is available to Great Bay or (ii) within a
reasonable period of time if a commercially acceptable workaround is available
or (iii) with the next Update or release of the Software or SMS if the Error is
cosmetic or not material to the use of the Software or the SMS. ACSC agrees to
provide Required Additions and/or Changes no later than two weeks prior to the
effective date of such statutory, regulatory and/or accounting practices
changes.

(e) Provision of Supplier Lists.  Upon the signing of this Agreement,
ACSC shall provide Greate Bay with a list of SMS Hardware component suppliers
and shall, upon any addition or change to such supplier list, provide Greate Bay
with an updated list.  In consideration of being provided with a list of SMS
Hardware component suppliers, Greate Bay promises not to purchase SMS Hardware
components directly from such suppliers absent a default by ACSC of its
obligations under this Paragraph 6.

(f) Equitable Remedies.  The obligations of ACSC in this Paragraph 6
shall be specifically enforceable and ACSC agrees that (i) any breach of ACSC's
obligations under this Paragraph 6 would cause irreparable injury to Greate Bay;
(ii) Greate Bay would have an inadequate remedy at law for any such breach;
(iii) the balance of interests and hardships would favor an injunction in favor
of Greate Bay; (iv) the public interest would favor an injunction in favor of
Greate Bay, and (v) ACSC will make no legal arguments that equitable relief is
not an appropriate remedy in favor of Greate Bay in the event of a breach of
ACSC's obligations under this Paragraph.

7.   ESCROW OF THE ""COLLECTOR"" LOGIC BOARD SOURCE CODE.  The Escrow Agent
for the Source Code for the operating system of the ""Collector"" Logic Board
shall be Greate Bay's General Counsel. ACSC shall cause the Source Code for the
operating system of the ""Collector"" Logic Board to be deposited with the Escrow
Agent within seven (7) days of signing this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall
acknowledge receipt of the Source Code and shall keep same in a safe secure
location. Except as set forth below, the Escrow Agent shall not allow or permit
any party or third party to have access to, copies of or information concerning
the Source Code held in escrow. Upon receipt of written certification

<PAGE>

from Greate Bay's Vice President-MIS that ACSC has either ceased doing business
and there is no successor in interest that has assumed the obligations of ACSC
or that ACSC is in default of its obligations under this Agreement, the Escrow
Agent shall release the escrowed material to Greate Bay solely for the purpose
of allowing Greate Bay to provide itself with support services and to effect the
repair, replacement, maintenance and/or debugging of the ""Collector"" Logic Board
as determined by Greate Bay.

8.   INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY WARRANTIES.  INDEMNIFICATION.  ACSC represents
and warrants that ACSC knows of no fact, circumstance or claim that the exercise
of rights pursuant to this Agreement would infringe any valid and subsisting
intellectual property right owned by any other persons.  Greate Bay acknowledges
and understands that Greate Bay must obtain licenses for the serial or other
protocols from the respective game manufacturers necessary to interface the
Software and the SMS with the games of each manufacturer.  ACSC will defend at
its expense or settle at its option, any action brought against Greate Bay to
the extent that it is based on a claim that the Software, the SMS Hardware or
the SMS Software or the Configuration, as used within the scope of this
Agreement, infringes any copyright or United States patent.  ACSC will pay any
attorneys' fees, costs and damages awarded against or incurred by Greate Bay in
such actions which are attributable to such claim provided that Greate Bay
notifies ACSC in writing of the claim within five (5) calendar days of the
service or other notification of such claim upon Greate Bay and ACSC fully
controls the defense and settlement of such claims.  Should the Software or the
SMS or the SMS Software or the Configuration become, or, in ACSC's opinion, be
likely to become the subject of a claim of infringement of a copyright or
patent, ACSC may procure for Greate Bay the right to continue using the
Software, the SMS or the SMS Software or the Configuration or replace or modify
the Software, the SMS or the SMS Software or the Configuration to make it non-
infringing, provided that no such replacement or modification shall decrease or
adversely change the performance of the Software or SMS or the Configuration and
further provided that no such replacement or modification shall cause Error.
ACSC shall have no liability for any claim of copyright or patent infringement
based on the use or combination of the Software, the SMS, SMS Software or the
Configuration with programs or data not supplied by ACSC.  Any indemnity
provided herein shall not exceed and shall expressly be limited to Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00).

(e)  Disclaimer of All Other Warranties and Representations.  The
express warranties and express representations set forth in this Agreement are

WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS
OR SUITABILITY FOR ANY PURPOSE (WHETHER OR NOT ACSC KNOWS, HAS REASON TO KNOW,

ALLEGED TO ARISE BY LAW, BY REASON OF CUSTOM OR USAGE IN THE TRADE, OR BY COURSE
OF

<PAGE>

DEALING. IN ADDITION, ACSC EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION TO

provided in the next sentence.  With respect to the Electronic Drop feature of
the SMS (""EDrop""), ACSC will submit the EDropcode for approval, provided the
applicable gaming authority has authorized implementation of EDrop on a
conceptual basis either by established policy or published regulation.  If
approval of EDrop has been so authorized by the applicable gaming authority,
ACSC will conform the logic of the EDrop code to any applicable and generally
applied specifications of the gaming authority.  Greate Bay agrees that it is
solely responsible for all testing and internal control compliance with respect
to the SMS, including, but not limited to, security of the computer system

reasonable assistance requested of it by Greate Bay with respect to testing and
internal control compliance.

the Software, the SMS, the Source Code and all other information supplied by
ACSC in connection with this Agreement, including but not limited to any know-
how or expertise, (collectively, the ""Confidential Information""), will be deemed
confidential/proprietary information of ACSC.  Greate Bay agrees that it shall

information.

required by or on behalf of any gaming authority, Greate Bay shall not disclose
any Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written
consent of ACSC. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Greate Bay may make the Software
or the SMS Software available, without ACSC's prior express consent, to any
independent consultant or consulting group retained by Greate Bay solely for
purposes specifically related to Greate Bay's permitted use, operation and
application of the Software or the SMS, but only after such independent
consultant or consulting group has executed a written confidentiality agreement
pursuant to which it covenants to not use the Confidential Information except
for Greate Bay as permitted herein and to not

<PAGE>

disclose the Confidential Information under the same conditions of
confidentiality contained herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Greate Bay may
disclose appropriate portions of Confidential Information to those of its
personnel who have a need to know the specific information in question in
connection with Greate Bay's rights or the performance of obligations under this
Agreement. All such personnel will be instructed by Greate Bay that the
Confidential Information is subject to the obligation of confidentiality set
forth by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Greate Bay may disclose
Confidential Information to an entity that is not a competitor of ACSC and is
offering (i) a Plan of Reorganization in the Chapter 11 Proceeding or (ii) to
purchase control of Greate Bay, provided however, that any such entity shall
enter into a non-disclosure agreement that requires such entity to protect such
information in the same manner as is required by this Paragraph 10.

Paragraph 10 shall be specifically enforceable and Greate Bay agrees that (i)
any breach of Greate Bay's obligations under this Paragraph 10 would cause
irreparable injury to ACSC; (ii) ACSC would have an inadequate remedy at law for
any such breach; (iii) the balance of interests and hardships would favor an
injunction in favor of ACSC; (iv) the public interest would favor an injunction
in favor of ACSC, and (v) Greate Bay will make no legal arguments that equitable
relief is not an appropriate remedy in favor of ACSC in the event of a breach of
Greate Bay's obligations under this Paragraph.

11.  EXCLUSION OF INCIDENTAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.  NEITHER PARTY WILL
BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY (NOR TO ANY PERSON CLAIMING RIGHTS DERIVED FROM THE
OTHER PARTY'S RIGHTS) FOR INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR
EXEMPLARY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, including lost profits or revenue, loss of
business, or other economic damage, and further including injury to property, AS
A RESULT OF BREACH OF ANY WARRANTY OR OTHER TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS
OF WHETHER THE PARTY LIABLE OR ALLEGEDLY LIABLE WAS ADVISED OR HAD OTHER REASON
TO KNOW OR IN FACT KNEW OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.  Independent of, severable
from, and to be enforced independently of any other enforceable or unenforceable
provision of this Agreement, IN NO EVENT SHALL ACSC's AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO
GREATE BAY (INCLUDING TO ANY PERSON OR PERSONS WHOSE CLAIM OR CLAIMS ARE BASED
ON OR DERIVED FROM A RIGHT OR RIGHT CLAIMED BY GREATE BAY), WITH RESPECT TO ANY
AND ALL CLAIMS AT ANY AND ALL TIMES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THE SUBJECT
MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT, IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED ONE MILLION

not an appropriate remedy in favor of ACSC in the event of a breach of Greate
Bay's obligations under this Agreement.

13.  ASSIGNMENT.  Greate Bay may not assign any right under this Agreement
and any purported assignment will be null and void and a breach of this
Agreement.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a change of control of
Greate Bay shall not constitute an assignment, and Greate Bay shall have the
right to assign its rights under this Agreement to any person or entity
acquiring substantially all of the assets of Greate Bay or at least 51 percent
of the equity of Greate Bay through purchase, merger, or reorganization and any
such person shall in turn have the right to assign to any other person coming
within the exception provided in this sentence.  ACSC shall have the right to
assign its rights under this Agreement provided that any such assignee shall
expressly assume ACSC's obligations to Greate Bay pursuant to this Agreement and
that the assignment shall include sufficient Intellectual Property, personnel
and other know how such that ACSC can reasonably expect the Assignee to be able
to fulfill the obligations to Greate Bay under this Agreement.

party respectively has full right, power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and the person executing this Agreement on its behalf has actual
authority to do so.

CASINO ACCOUNTING AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEM


CASINO MANAGEMENT
The casino management module provides both detailed and summarized
information to executive level, casino management and administration and
pit management.  Through integration of the applications outlined as
follows, management has access to both real time and historical performance
information from a single source (or menu).


TABLE ACCOUNTING & CREDIT
This system integrates all aspects of table games and cage accounting in
addition to patron credit activity.  Additional controls provide automated
and paper less casino credit account review via predefined ""triggers"" and
electronic communications with service providers of casino and credit
bureau information.

SLOT ACCOUNTING AND MANAGEMENT APPLICATION


SLOT ACCOUNTING & MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
The Slot system is comprised of three modules;
Slot Configuration - allows recording of individual game
specifications and is used to maintain the SMS slot network.  Future
changes to floor configurations may be entered and activated as
required.
Slot Accounting - using the metered information received from SMS,
this module provides complete accounting for all coin, currency and
electronic fund transfers.
Slot Data - provides historical and analytical information regarding
game performance and may be accessed through numerous summary and
detailed selection criteria.
<PAGE>

EXHIBIT ""C""

CASINO PLAYER TRACKING SYSTEM


SUB-SET-RATINGS & COMPLEMENTARIES
This application also performs as the primary information data bank of
information specific to individual patrons gaming activity and
profitability.  Information from both table and slot activity is combined
with the ability to view this information and either combined or
independently.  A complimentary decision process has been incorporated so
that improved customer service may result by removing the requirement for
executive decisions on all issuances.
<PAGE>

EXHIBIT ""D""

CASINO SALES AND MARKETING SYSTEM


ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT
This module provides the ""housekeeping"" functions required to maintain an
accurate data bank of patron information for marketing purposes.  It also
serves to reduce cost specifically for the direct mail marketing
application and purging of inactive patrons.

EXTRACT MANAGEMENT
This is a flexible and robust patron selection module used primarily to
target specific segments of patrons for various marketing and/or analysis
functions.  The results of these extracts may be directed towards numerous
forms of processing.

GROUPS/INVITATION SYSTEM
The primary purpose of the group system is to enable the analysis of
profitability, both actual and potential, for up to twenty (20) user
defined groups or event types.  Expenses and/or complementaries may be
charged direct to a patrons account or as a percentage of theoretical
across all players within the group.  Groups may also include Branch
Offices and Junket Representatives with the ability to compute commissions.
Historical analysis by group type or monthly rep performance is provided.
The invitation module enables the booking of patrons responses to specific
events (i.e. Head liner shows).  Blocking of an event enables analysis
based on invited segment(s).

SWEEPSTAKES SYSTEM
The sweepstakes system provided for the controlling and winner selection
electronically for various promotional sweepstakes.  Entries earned by
patrons are automatically recorded with randomized winner selection based
on event, date and time of day.  If required entries may require pre-
qualification.  Linkage to the direct mail provides for notification of
entries.
<PAGE>

EXHIBIT ""E""

TABLE MARKETING SYSTEM

TABLE MARKETING SYSTEM (TMS)
TMS was developed as an extension of the SMS for table games and utilizes
the same network and controller boards (with function keypads and mark
sense printers).  The primary purposes of TMS consist of: a) control of
complementaries at the table games; b) access to patron information for
ratings, credit and tracking of cash transactions; and c) time and
attendance for pit personnel.
<PAGE>

EXHIBIT ""F'

CASINO ANALYSIS
This system provides the analysis department with information on patrons
gaming history.  Data extraction options allow flexibility in selecting
patron segments for analysis, and an interface to the Group system allows
group analysis.  Data can be interpreted in report format, or downloaded to
a PC for analysis utilizing PC based software, i.e. Foxpro.  Selections
from PC analysis can also be uploaded to the AS/400 to drive the Sales &
Marketing extract system.

MIS RESOURCE REQUEST SYSTEM
The MIS Resource Request system allows the entry and tracking of requests
for maintenance and new requests for Software, Hardware, and other services
provided by MIS.  The system utilizes control files to allow flexibility in
establishing Application areas and allows tracking of the progress of a
request from initial request entry through completion.  For Software
revisions, the system incorporates source and object movement to control
the development/testing cycle and movement to a production environment.
Tracking and reporting of man hours by request is also available.

SECURITY INCIDENT REPORTING SYSTEM
This system provides for the entry of Security Incident data to allow
tracking and reporting of various types of incidents.  Incidents can be
tracked from initiation through closure, and some limited claim/settlement
tracking is provided.

CROSS SYSTEM BACKUP (CSB)
This application is used in a multiple CPU environment to provide a 'hot'
backup capability, for use in the event of a severe hardware failure.  CSB
utilizes the Journaling feature of the AS/400 to capture changes to
designated application system files on a CPU, and transmits the changes to
another CPU, where the CSB application on this CPU applies the changes to
the application files residing on that CPU.

of programs, systems and services intended to support such prepaid cellular
telephones (hereinafter referred to as the ""Business"").

B. US/INTELICOM has the exclusive right, title and interest in and to
said application software for prepaid cellular telephones (hereinafter referred
to as the ""Software"").

C. US/INTELICOM has agreed with Licensee to provide the Software to
Licensee for installation of the Software on the Phones and to sell, lease and
distribute the Phones to Licensee's customers, subject to the terms and

distribution of prepaid cellular telephones.

E. The Licensee desires to sell and market Phones installed with the
Software, on the terms and conditions set forth herein.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of mutual covenants and agreements set
forth herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt, sufficiency
and adequacy of which the parties conclusively acknowledge, the parties agree as
follows:

1.       Grant of License.

US/INTELICOM hereby grants to Licensee, a limited, worldwide,
nontransferable, nonexclusive, conditional right and license to use the Software
solely with the Phones and to reproduce the Software in connection with such
use, and Licensee hereby accepts said right, license and privilege, in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. US/INTELICOM agrees to provide the

2.       Term of License.

The term of this license shall be for an initial period of
forty-eight (48) months (""initial term""), commencing on the date of execution of
this Agreement. This license shall thereafter automatically renew on the
anniversary of this execution date for additional terms of twelve (12) months
(""subsequent terms""), unless Licensee sends written notification to US/INTELICOM
of Licensee's intention not to renew. Such notification must be received by
US/INTELICOM not less than ninety (90) days preceding the automatic annual
renewal.

3.       Fees.

As consideration for the rights granted and services provided
hereunder, Licensee shall remit fees to US/INTELICOM according to the fee

be subject to assignment or transfer in any manner whatsoever without the prior
express written consent of US/INTELICOM, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, and which consent shall be granted if the within license is conveyed
in connection with Licensee's sale of substantially all of its assets. If

Information.

(a)      Licensee and US/INTELICOM acknowledge that in the
course of this license, they will become acquainted
with each other's proprietary and confidential
information concerning the Software and the Business,
including ""Trade Secrets"" and ""Confidential
Information"", as defined below. Both parties further
acknowledge that they each expend substantial
resources in time and money in the development of
their software, marketing, sales strategies,
programs, and in developing relationships with
customers.

(b)      As used herein, the term ""Trade Secrets"" shall mean
any and all information of either party, including
without limitation, the Software, and other technical
and non-technical data, formulas, patterns,
compilations, programs, devices, methods, techniques,
drawings, processes, financial data, financial plans,
product plans, or lists of actual or potential
customers or suppliers, which (i) derive economic
value, actual or potential, from not being generally
known to, and not being readily ascertainable by
proper means by, other persons who can obtain
economic value from their disclosure or use; and (ii)
are the subject of efforts that are reasonable under
the circumstances to maintain their secrecy. ""Trade
Secrets"" excludes however, information in the public
domain or readily ascertainable from third parties.

Page 6 of 15                      Confidential
<PAGE>   7

(c)      As used herein, the term ""Confidential Information""
shall mean proprietary and confidential information
or data, other than Trade Secrets, which is valuable
to, and related to the Software and the Business and
the details of which are generally unknown to the
competitors of either party. Confidential Information
shall include the following information, without
limitation, to the extent such information is not
already included in the definition of Trade Secrets
either at the time of the execution of this Agreement
or any time thereafter: (i) confidential financial,
business, marketing programs, strategies, and
services of either party; and (ii) such other
materials and items as the parties may designate,
mark or otherwise identify as confidential from time
to time. Any such information shall cease to be
Confidential Information for the purposes of this
Agreement at such time as that specific information
becomes generally known to the public unless such
disclosure is in violation of this Agreement or
another agreement of a similar purpose between
US/INTELICOM or Licensee and any third party.

(d)      Licensee and US/INTELICOM hereby covenant and agree
that they shall not at any time, directly or
indirectly, misappropriate, take, use, divulge or
disclose any of the Trade Secrets of the other party
to any person, company, firm or entity for so long as
an item which is a Trade Secret remains a trade
secret under applicable law.

(e)      Licensee and US/INTELICOM hereby covenant and agree
that during the tem of this Agreement and for a
period of thirty-six (36) months after the
termination of this engagement for any reason, they
shall not misappropriate, take, use, divulge or
disclose any of the Confidential Information of the
other party.

(f)      Licensee and US/INTELICOM further covenant and agree
that all the Trade Secrets and Confidential
Information owned by each party shall remain the
property of that party and that, upon any termination
of this Agreement for any reason, each party shall
immediately return to the other party any tangible or
electronic representations or reproductions of any
Trade Secret or Confidential Information in their
possession or which they have received or acquired.

(g)      Licensee and US/INTELICOM acknowledge the
confidential status of the Trade Secrets and the
Confidential Information.

11.      Enforcement.

(a)      Licensee and US/INTELICOM acknowledge and agree that
(i) the foregoing covenants set forth in Section 10
above are an essential part

Page 7 of 15                      Confidential
<PAGE>   8


of this Agreement; (ii) the terms of the covenants
are reasonable; (iii) any breach of a covenant would
result in immediate and irreparable harm to the other
party; and (iv) such damages would be difficult to
ascertain and would not be entirely measurable in
money damages. Therefore, Licensee and US/INTELICOM
agree that, in the event of a breach or threatened
breach of a covenant, either party shall be entitled
to an injunction or other equitable relief to
restrain any breach or threatened breach of a
covenant, in addition to the right of either party to
an award of damages or other relief that the parties
may have under the law, including without limitation
reasonable attorney's fees and expenses incurred by
the other party in enforcing any claim hereunder,
regardless of any claim that either party may have or
assert against the other party.

(b)      Licensee and US/INTELICOM agree that the covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement are
separate, severable and independent of each other, as
each term and condition is based on viable and
independent consideration and is of great importance
to each party and should be enforceable as if each
were made the subject of a separate agreement between
US/INTELICOM and Licensee. Therefore, should any
court of competent jurisdiction declare any covenant
or provision of this Agreement invalid or
unenforceable for any reason, the remaining covenant
and other terms this Agreement shall continue in full
force and effect as if this Agreement had been
executed initially without the covenant or provision.

12.      Force Majeure.

If the performance of all or any part of this Agreement by
US/INTELICOM or the Licensee is prevented or delayed by acts of civil or
military authority, flood, fire, epidemic, war or riot, which cannot be averted
or overcome by diligence (hereinafter referred to as a ""Force Majeure Event""),
the party affected shall be excused from such performance, to the extent that
party is necessarily prevented or delayed thereby, only during the continuance
of any such Force Majeure Event; provided, however, that if such delay in
performance extends for more than thirty (30) days, the other party, at its
discretion, upon giving written notice, may terminate this Agreement.

13.      Miscellaneous.

(a)      This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties and their respective
successors and assigns.

(b)      This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and
understanding of the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement. No revision,
modification or change in this Agreement whatsoever


Page 8 of 15                      Confidential
<PAGE>   9

shall be claimed or become valid unless the same is
in writing and executed by the parties.

(c)      The failure of a party to insist, in one or more
instances, on the performance by the other in strict
compliance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, shall not be deemed to be a waiver or
relinquishment of any right granted hereunder or of
any term or condition of this Agreement unless such
waiver is in writing and executed by the parties.

(d)      Any notice or other communication required or
permitted hereunder shall be in writing and delivered
personally or by registered mail, return receipt
requested, with sufficient postage, to the best
available address of the party to be notified, and
shall be deemed to be effective on the earlier of
actual receipt of four (4) days after postmarking by
the U.S. Postal Service.

(e)      The obligations of the parties created by the
provisions of this Agreement shall survive any
termination of this Agreement.

(f)      The headings or captions used in this Agreement are
inserted for convenience or reference purposes only
and shall neither constitute a part hereof nor effect
the interpretation of any provision of this
Agreement.

(g)      This Agreement is for the benefit of only the parties
hereto and no person, firm or entity that is not a
party to this Agreement shall have any rights or
claims under or by virtue of this Agreement.

(h)      As used herein, the singular shall include the plural

ADDENDUM A

FEES

SOFTWARE LICENSE FEE

Licensee agrees to pay to US/INTELICOM a software license fee of twelve ($12.00)
per Phone on which the Software is loaded, and sold or leased by Licensee.


PIN UPDATE FEE

The ""PIN update"" method of adding additional prepaid cellular airtime to a Phone
involves entering a unique 10 or 12 digit number directly into the Phone via the
keypad. Such PINs can be divided into two separate types:

a)       Mass Production PINs - Licensee creates collections of PINs as
part of a mass PIN production process. As a rule, such PINs are
then packaged, distributed and sold via a variety of retail
channels.

b)       On-demand PINs - Licensee creates individual PINs on an ad hoc
basis that are then supplied to the customer over the telephone.
Licensee may create and supply as many on-demand PINs as
indicated.

Licensee agrees to also pay to US/INTELICOM a fee of two dollars ($2.00) per PIN
code generated for use in adding additional units of airtime to Licensee's
Phones. Mass Production PINs are restricted to a maximum of 120 units each.


REAL TIME PREPAID FEE

The ""Real Time PrePaid (RTPP)"" method of adding additional prepaid cellular
airtime to a Phone does NOT require the use of a PIN code. Under this method,
the Phone will automatically place a call to Licensee's computer system and
request Licensee's permission to add a specified amount of airtime to the Phone.
Licensee's computer system will either approve or deny this request.

Licencee agrees to pay to US/INTELICOM an ongoing fee of two dollars ($2.00) per
Real Time PrePaid (RTPP) addition of units of airtime to Licensee's Phones.


PROMOTIONAL DISCOUNTS

US/INTELICOM agrees to offer a promotional discount of its fees for certain of
Licensee's Phones.


Page 11 of 15                      Confidential
<PAGE>   12


- -        To be eligible for this promotional discount, a Phone must ""qualify"" by
being sold or leased by Licensee to a customer directly acquired by
Licensee in the normal course of Licensee's telemarketing, direct
marketing and telesales business.

- -        Any Phone sold or leased by Licensee that uses a Mass Production PIN in
adding additional units or airtime usage will not qualify for
promotional discount.

- -        Promotional discounts shall be used to offset all license fees due
hereunder.

US/INTELICOM agrees to the following promotional discounts:

1.       Nine dollars ($9.00) to be applied against its Software License
fee for each qualified Uniden PCD2000 and each qualified Kodenshi
T-100 Phone containing the Software sold or leased by Licensee.

2.       Seven dollars ($7.00) to be applied against its Software License
fee for any other qualified prepaid Phone sold or leased by
Licensee.

3.       Two dollars ($2.00) to be applied against each Real Time PrePaid
(RTPP) fee incurred by Licensee in adding additional airtime to
qualified Phones of Licensee.

4.       Two dollars ($2.00) to be applied against each PIN Update fee
incurred by Licensee in adding additional airtime to qualified
Phones of Licensee via On-demand PINs.

ADDENDUM B

OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS

CONFIDENTIALITY

Licensee understands and agrees that the unauthorized disclosure of certain
details contained within this License Agreement could cause irreparable harm to
US/INTELICOM. Licensee therefore agrees to treat this License Agreement as
confidential and will not disclose any details of this License Agreement to any
third party without the expressed written permission of US/INTELICOM, except
that Licensee shall be free to make such disclosures as is necessary to fulfill
legal obligations.


SOFTWARE SOURCE NON-DISCLOSURE

Licensee and US/INTELICOM agree to treat as confidential and not disclose the
fact that Licensee is acquiring its prepaid Software from US/INTELICOM, except
that Licensee shall be free to make such disclosures as is necessary to fulfill
legal obligations. US/INTELICOM may, however, request from Licensee a disclosure
of relevant facts and opinions to specified individuals and/or organizations in
order to assist US/INTELICOM's sales and marketing efforts. Such a request for
disclosure may be declined by Licensee if it feels there is a reasonable chance
that such disclosure would have a materially negative impact on its own sales
and marketing effort. Unless specifically authorized in writing, Licensee agrees
not to use the US/INTELICOM name, logo or other identification of US/INTELICOM
in any of its sales, marketing, promotional, product, or technical information,
whether printed, verbal, or provided via any other media.


COMPUTING FACILITIES

US/INTELICOM agrees to install certain computer programs relating to the support
of its prepaid cellular Software onto computer systems by Licensee. Licensee
acknowledges that it has requested such programs be installed on Licensee's
computer systems, and Licensee agrees to bear all costs associated with
providing and maintaining these systems subject to Licensee's prior written
approval and authorization for such systems. Licensee agrees to provide
US/INTELICOM with continuous and appropriate Internet access to such systems for
billing, monitoring, updating, and other purposes. Licensee agrees to compensate
US/INTELICOM for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in supporting Licensee's
systems, including any related travel and accommodation expenses.


PAYMENT TERMS

Licensee agrees to remit payment to US/INTELICOM for all fees and other charges
described



Page 13 of 15                      Confidential
<PAGE>   14

herein within fifteen (15) days following initial receipt of invoices detailing
such fees and other charges, subject to offsets for promotional discounts that
Licensee is entitled to receive hereunder.


PREPAYMENT OF LICENSE FEES

Licensee agrees to remit to US/INTELICOM a nonrefundable prepayment of Software
License fees within three (3) business days following the date of execution of
this Agreement. The amount of this prepayment is agreed to be three hundred
thousand dollars ($300,000.00), which sum shall offset and be applied against
any License fees, less any applicable promotional discounts, otherwise due from
Licensee hereunder.


PURCHASE OF CELLULAR TELEPHONES

In the event that Licensee enters into a business arrangement in which it
acquires the right to purchase cellular telephones and other cellular
accessories, US/INTELICOM shall have the right to acquire such equipment, either
directly or for another business entity not engaged in direct response
marketing, under the same pricing and terms as Licensee, subject to availability
and vendor approval. It is explicitly understood and agreed that the price for
such equipment will be the lowest price available under Licensee's arrangement
and will be net of any and all discounts, rebates and other incentives.


CONVERSIONS OF PREPAID SOFTWARE

In the event that Licensee shall request that US/INTELICOM convert its prepaid
cellular software so that the application can be made available on a specified
cellular phone, US/INTELICOM agrees to use its best reasonable efforts to effect
such a conversion in a mutually acceptable timeframe. Licensee understands and
agrees that US/INTELICOM shall have the right to reject a software conversion
request from Licensee in the event that US/INTELICOM determines that the
specified cellular phone does not adequately meet the minimum technical and
operational standards determined by US/INTELICOM. Licensee agrees to reimburse
US/INTELICOM for the actual cost of any such conversion request received from
Licensee, based upon a cost schedule approved by Licensee.

RESTRICTIVE COVENANT

US/INTELICOM agrees not to compete with Licensee by engaging in the sale of
prepaid cellular phones directly to end-user customers through direct response
marketing for as long as this Agreement is active.

<PAGE>   15


MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT

Licensee acknowledges and agrees that it is both desirable and necessary for
US/INTELICOM to provide ongoing professional services to Licensee for
installation assistance, operational support and continued maintenance of
software installed and running on computer hardware and cellular telephones
controlled and/or sold by Licensee.

US/INTELICOM agrees to provide reasonable support and maintenance services to
Licensee under a Full Time Equivalent (""FTE"") arrangement. US/INTELICOM agrees
to initially provide Licensee with one (1) FTE of appropriate professional
services. A Full Time Equivalent is any combination of support and maintenance
time provided by Licensee by US/INTELICOM personnel. Any FTE is limited to one
hundred and sixty-seven (167) hours of professional time per month.

Licensee agrees to pay to US/INTELICOM a monthly fee of ten thousand dollars
($10,000.00) per FTE of maintenance and support (the ""FTE fee""). Licensee also
agrees to reimburse US/INTELICOM for all out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
providing support and maintenance services.

This monthly maintenance and support arrangement will have an initial term of
six (6) months. The arrangement will then automatically renew for an additional
twelve (12) months at the above rates and conditions unless written notification
to US/INTELICOM of Licensee's intent to cancel the arrangement is received no
later than September 1, 1998. Unless Licensee elects to cancel this arrangement
at the end of the first six months, the ""initial term"" of the arrangement will
be through September 30, 1999.

Following the initial term, this arrangement will automatically renew for an
additional twelve (12) months (""subsequent renewals"") beginning each September
1st (the ""renewal date"") unless written notification to US/INTELICOM of
Licensee's intent to cancel the arrangement is received no later than sixty (60)
days prior to the renewal date. Each subsequent renewal will include an annual
ten percent (10%) increase in the monthly FTE fee.

Licensee may elect to increase the number of FTEs available for the support and
maintenance of Licensee's business by sending a written request to US/INTELICOM.
US/INTELICOM agrees to utilize its best reasonable efforts to provide such
additional FTEs upon such terms as the parties agree at that time.

provisions in Section 11 hereof, is entitled to seek an injunction to
prevent such breach or threatened breach; provided, however, no specification
of a particular

legal or equitable remedy is to be construed as a
waiver, prohibition, or limitation of any legal or equitable remedies in the
event of a breach hereof.





6.             INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

agreements, and (iii) shall be protected by the receiving party in
accordance with the terms of this Section 7.

shall Licensee disclose RMSS Proprietary Information to a Competitor of RMSS.
Each party shall use the same degree of care and afford the same protections to
the Proprietary Information of the other party as it uses and affords to its
own Proprietary Information.





7.3          Exceptions.  Proprietary Information shall not be deemed proprietary and, subject to
the carve-out below, the receiving party shall have no obligation of
nondisclosure with respect to any such information which:





(i)            is or becomes publicly known

third party that was free of obligations of confidentiality to the party
providing the information;





(iii)          is approved for release by written
authorization of the disclosing party;

receipt of the information;





(v)           was independently developed by the receiving
party without access to or use of the Proprietary Information of the disclosing
party; or

Notwithstanding application of any of the foregoing
exceptions, in no event shall RMSS treat as other than Proprietary Information,
information comprising nonpublic personal information under the GLB Act.





7.4          Confidentiality of this Agreement; Protective Arrangements.





(a)           The parties acknowledge that this Agreement
contains confidential information that may be considered proprietary by one or
both of the parties, and agree to limit distribution of this Agreement to those
employees of Licensee and RMSS with a need to know the contents of this
Agreement or as required by law or national stock exchange rule. In no event
may this Agreement be reproduced or copies shown to any third parties (except
counsel, auditors and professional advisors) without the prior written consent
of the other party, except as may be necessary by reason of legal, accounting,
tax or regulatory requirements, in which event Licensee and RMSS agree to
exercise reasonable diligence in limiting such disclosure to the minimum
necessary under the particular circumstances.





(b)           In addition, each party shall give notice to
the other party of any demands to disclose or provide Proprietary Information

8.             CONTINUING UNDERTAKINGS.





During the duration of the license granted
hereunder, RMSS shall offer Maintenance for the RMSS Software for the fees set
forth in Exhibit C hereto. A description of Maintenance services is set
forth in Exhibit B hereto. Any related professional services shall be
performed pursuant to further agreement between the parties.





9.             INVOICING AND PAYMENTS, PAST DUE
AMOUNTS, CURRENCY.





9.1          Invoicing and Payment
Requirements.  RMSS shall invoice for such fees described in
Exhibit C hereto as well as for any expenses and any other applicable
charges incurred and owing hereunder. In accordance with this Section 9.1,
Licensee shall pay RMSS the invoiced amount in full on or prior to thirty (30)
Days after Licensee’s receipt of such invoice unless Licensee notifies RMSS
within such period that it is in good faith disputing RMSS’s invoice. Licensee
shall make all payments to RMSS by check, credit card or wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated by RMSS. Payment in full shall not preclude later dispute of
charges or adjustment of improper payments.





9.2          Past
Due Amounts.  Any amount not received
or disputed by Licensee by the date payment is due shall be subject to interest
on the overdue balance at a rate equal to the prime rate as published in the
table money rates in the Wall Street Journal on the date of payment (or the
prior date on which the Wall Street Journal was published if not published on
the date of payment), plus one percent from the due date, until paid, applied
to the outstanding balance from time to time. Any amount paid but later deemed
not to have been due, will be repaid or credited with interest on the same
terms.





9.3          Currency.  All fees and charges listed and referred to
in this Agreement are stated in and shall be paid in U.S. Dollars.





10.          ASSISTANCE.





10.1        Basis for Assistance.  Assistance, except to the extent included in Maintenance, is not
included in this Agreement. If Licensee desires to purchase Assistance from
RMSS or a RMSS Subsidiaries, such Assistance shall be provided pursuant to
separate agreement.





11.          DISPUTE RESOLUTION.





11.1        Dispute Resolution Procedures.  If, prior to the termination of this Agreement or the license granted
herein, and prior to notice of termination given by either party to the other,
a dispute arises between RMSS and Licensee with respect to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, or any subject matter governed by this Agreement
(other than disputes regarding a party’s compliance with the provisions





10




















of Sections 4 and/or 7), such dispute shall be settled
as set forth in this Section 10. If either party exercises its right to
initiate the dispute resolution procedures under this Section 11, then
during such procedure any time periods providing for termination of the
Agreement or curing any material breach pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
shall be suspended automatically, except with respect to any termination or
breach arising out of Licensee’s failure to make any undisputed timely and
complete payments to RMSS under this Agreement. At such time as the dispute is
resolved, if such dispute involved the payment of monies, interest at a rate
equal to the prime rate as published in the table money rates in the Wall
Street Journal on the date the dispute is resolved (or the prior date on which the
Wall Street Journal was published if not published on the date the dispute was
resolved) plus one percent for the period of dispute shall be paid to the party
entitled to receive the disputed monies to compensate for the lapsed time
between the date such disputed amount originally was to have been paid (or was
paid) through the date monies are paid (or repaid) in settlement of the
dispute. Disputes arising under Sections 4 or 7 may be resolved by judicial
recourse or in any other manner agreed by the parties.





11.2        Escalation Procedures.





(a)           Each of the parties shall
escalate and negotiate, in good faith, any claim or dispute that has not been
satisfactorily resolved between the parties at the level where the issue is
discovered and has immediate impact (excluding issues of title to work product,
which shall be initially addressed at the general counsel level but otherwise pursuant
to Section 11.2(b) following). To this end, each party shall escalate
any and all unresolved disputes or claims in accordance with this Section 11.2
at any time to persons responsible for the administration of the relationship
reflected in this TEAM Software License Agreement. The location, format,
frequency, duration and conclusion of these elevated discussions shall be left
to the discretion of the representatives involved. If such parties do not
resolve the underlying dispute within ten (10) Days of its escalation to
them, then either party may notify the other in writing that he/she desires to
elevate the dispute or claim to the President of RMSS and the President of
Licensee or their designated representative(s) for resolution.





(b)           Upon receipt by a party of a
written notice escalating the dispute to the company president level, the
President of RMSS and the President of Licensee or their designated
representative(s) shall promptly communicate with his/her counter party,
negotiate in good faith and use reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute or
claim. The location, format, frequency, duration and conclusion of these elevated
discussions shall be left to the discretion of the representatives involved.
Upon agreement, such representatives may utilize other alternative dispute
resolution procedures to assist in the negotiations. If the parties have not
resolved the dispute





11




















within ten (10) Days after receipt of the notice
elevating the dispute to this level, either may once again escalate the dispute
to binding arbitration.





(c)           All discussions and
correspondence among the representatives for purposes of these negotiations
shall be treated as Proprietary Information developed for purposes of
settlement, exempt from discovery and production, which shall not be admissible
in any subsequent proceedings between the parties. Documents identified in or
provided with such communications, which are not prepared for purposes of the
negotiations, are not so exempted and may, if otherwise admissible, be admitted
in evidence in such subsequent proceeding.





11.3        Arbitration Procedures.  If a claim, controversy or dispute between the parties with respect to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, or any subject matter governed by
this Agreement (and not otherwise excepted), has not been timely resolved
pursuant to the foregoing escalation process, upon notice either party may
initiate binding arbitration of the issue in accordance with the following
procedures.





(a)           Either party may request
arbitration by giving the other party written notice to such effect, which
notice shall describe, in reasonable detail, the nature of the dispute,
controversy or claim. Such arbitration shall be governed by the then current
version of the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures of
the American Arbitration Association. The Arbitration will be conducted in
Jacksonville, Florida in front of one mutually agreed upon arbitrator.





(b)           Each party shall bear its
own fees, costs and expenses of the arbitration and its own legal expenses,
attorneys’ fees and costs of all experts and witnesses. Unless the award
provides otherwise, the fees and expenses of the arbitration procedures,
including the fees of the arbitrator or arbitrators, will be shared equally by
the involved parties.





(c)           Any award rendered pursuant
to such arbitration shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the parties,
and any judgment thereon may be entered and enforced in any court of competent
jurisdiction.





11.5        Continuation of Services.  Unless RMSS initiates an action for Licensee’s failure
to make timely and complete payment of undisputed amounts claimed due to RMSS,
RMSS will continue to provide Maintenance under the Maintenance services
agreement, and unless Licensee is unable to lawfully use the RMSS Software and
Modifications thereto, Licensee will continue to make payments of undisputed
amounts to RMSS, in accordance with this Agreement, notwithstanding a dispute
between the parties relating hereto or otherwise.

12.          LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.





12.1        EXCEPT
TO THE EXTENT ARISING FROM GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, BY REASON OF
AN INDEMNITY OBLIGATION HEREUNDER OR BY REASON OF A BREACH OF WARRANTY, EITHER
PARTY’S LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION WHETHER
BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE WHICH ARISES UNDER OR IS RELATED TO THIS
AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE OTHER PARTY’S DIRECT OUT-OF-POCKET DAMAGES,
ACTUALLY INCURRED, WHICH UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL EXCEED, IN THE AGGREGATE,
THE AMOUNT PAID BY LICENSEE TO RMSS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR THE 12-MONTH PERIOD
IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE THE CLAIM AROSE.





12.2        IN NO
EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL
OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER OR THE CLAIMS OR DEMANDS MADE
BY ANY THIRD PARTIES, WHETHER OR NOT IT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.





12.3        Licensee
Software.  RMSS has no
obligation or liability, either express or implied, with respect to the
compatibility of RMSS Software with any other software unless provided or
specified by RMSS including, but not limited to, Licensee software and/or
Licensee-provided third party software.





13.          INDEMNIFICATION.





13.1        Property
Damage.  Subject to Section 12
hereof, each party agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other and
its officers, directors, employees, and affiliates (including, where
applicable, the RMSS Subsidiaries and Licensee Subsidiaries), and agents from
any and all liabilities, losses, costs, damages and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from or in connection with the damage, loss
(including theft) or destruction of any real property or tangible personal
property of the indemnified party resulting from the actions or inactions of
any employee, agent or subcontractor of the indemnifying party insofar as such
damage arises out of or is ancillary to fulfilling its obligations under this
Agreement and to the extent such damage is due to any negligence, breach of
statutory duty, omission or default of the indemnifying party, its employees,
agents or subcontractors.





13.2        Infringement
of RMSS Software.  RMSS agrees to
defend at its own expense, any claim or action brought by any third party
against Licensee and/or against its officers, directors, and employees and
affiliates, for actual or alleged infringement within the United States of any
patent, copyright or other intellectual property





13




















right (including, but not limited to, misappropriation
of trade secrets) based upon the RMSS Software (except to the extent such
infringement claim is caused by Licensee-specified Custom Modifications to the
RMSS Software which could not have been made in a non-infringing manner) or
caused by the combination of RMSS Software with software or hardware not
provided, specified or approved by RMSS, or based upon the Third Party Software
(“Indemnified RMSS Software”). Licensee, at its sole discretion and cost, may
participate in the defense and all negotiations for its settlement or
compromise. RMSS further agrees to indemnify and hold Licensee, its officers,
directors, employees and affiliates harmless from and against any and all
liabilities, losses, costs, damages, and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys’ fees) associated with any such claim or action incurred by Licensee.
RMSS shall conduct and control the defense of any such claim or action and
negotiations for its settlement or compromise, by the payment of money. RMSS
shall give Licensee, and Licensee shall give RMSS, as appropriate, prompt
written notice of any written threat, warning or notice of any such claim or
action against RMSS or Licensee, as appropriate, or any other user or any
supplier of components of the Indemnified RMSS Software, which could have an
adverse impact on Licensee’s use of same, provided RMSS or Licensee, as
appropriate, knows of such claim or action. If in any such suit so defended,
all or any part of the Indemnified RMSS Software (or any component thereof) is
held to constitute an infringement or violation of any other party’s
intellectual property rights and is enjoined, RMSS shall at its sole option
take one or more of the following actions at no additional cost to Licensee: (i) procure
the right to continue the use of the same without material interruption for
Licensee; (ii) replace the same with non-infringing software; (iii) modify
said Indemnified RMSS Software so as to be non-infringing; or (iv) take
back the infringing Indemnified RMSS Software and credit Licensee with an
amount equal to its prepaid but unused license fees hereunder. The foregoing
represents the sole and exclusive remedy of Licensee for infringement or
alleged infringement.





13.3        Dispute
Resolution.  The provisions
of Section 13 shall apply with respect to the submission of any claim for
indemnification under this Agreement and the resolution of any disputes
relating to such claim.





14.          FORCE MAJEURE, TIME OF
PERFORMANCE AND INCREASED COSTS.





14.1        Force
Majeure.





(a)           Neither party
shall be held liable for any delay or failure in performance of its obligations
under this Agreement from any cause which with the observation of reasonable
care, could not have been avoided – which may include, without limitation, acts
of civil or military authority, government regulations, government agencies,
epidemics, war, terrorist acts, riots, insurrections, fires, explosions,
earthquakes, nuclear accidents, floods, power blackouts affecting facilities
(the “Affected Performance”).





14




















(b)           Upon the
occurrence of a condition described in Section 14.1(a), the party whose
performance is affected shall give written notice to the other party describing
the Affected Performance, and the parties shall promptly confer, in good faith,
to agree upon equitable, reasonable action to minimize the impact on both
parties of such condition, including, without limitation, implementing disaster
recovery procedures. The parties agree that the party whose performance is
affected shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the delay caused
by the force majeure events and recommence the Affected Performance. If the
delay caused by the force majeure event lasts for more than fifteen (15) Days,
the parties shall negotiate an equitable amendment to this Agreement with
respect to the Affected Performance. If the parties are unable to agree upon an
equitable amendment within ten (10) Days after such fifteen (15)-Day
period has expired, then either party shall be entitled to serve thirty (30)
Days’ notice of termination on the other party with respect to only such
Affected Performance. The remaining portion of the Agreement that does not
involve the Affected Performance shall continue in full force and effect. RMSS
shall be entitled to be paid for that portion of the Affected Performance which
it completed through the termination date.





14.2        Time of
Performance and Increased Costs.  RMSS’s time of
performance under this Agreement shall be adjusted, if and to the extent
reasonably necessary, in the event and to the extent that (i) Licensee
fails to timely submit material data or materials in the prescribed form or in
accordance with the requirements of this Agreement, (ii) Licensee fails to
perform on a timely basis, the material functions or other responsibilities of
Licensee described in this Agreement, (iii) Licensee or any governmental
agency authorized to regulate or supervise Licensee makes any special request,
which is affirmed by Licensee and/or compulsory on RMSS, which affects RMSS’s
normal performance schedule, or (iv) Licensee has modified the RMSS
Software in a manner affecting RMSS’s burden. In addition, if any of the above
events occur, and such event results in an increased cost to RMSS, RMSS shall
estimate such increased costs in writing in advance and, upon Licensee’s
approval, Licensee shall be required to pay any and all such reasonable,
increased costs to RMSS upon documented expenditure, up to 110% of the
estimate.

16




















be delivered free of undisclosed trapdoors, Trojan
horses, time bombs, time outs, spyware, viruses or other code which, with the

with the normal use of, or access to, any file, datum or system.





16.4        Exclusive
Warranties.  EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THIS
AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND EACH
PARTY AGREES THAT ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES THAT ARE NOT EXPRESSLY
PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED AND DISCLAIMED.





17.          MISCELLANEOUS.





17.1        Assignment.  Except as set forth herein, neither party may sell, assign, convey, or
transfer the licenses granted hereunder or any of such party’s rights or
interests, or delegate any of its obligations hereunder without the written
consent of the other party, provided, however, that the parties
hereby agree and acknowledge that, upon the consummation of the Merger, Merger
Co and Certegy shall each be permitted assignees of Licensee.  Any assignment hereunder shall be conditioned
upon the understanding that this Agreement shall be binding upon the assigning
party’s successors and assigns. Either party may assign this Agreement to any Subsidiary
that is not a Competitor except that the assigning party shall remain
responsible for all obligations under this Agreement including the payment of
fees. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Licensee may
not assign this Agreement to a Competitor.





17.2        Severability.  Provided
Licensee retains quiet enjoyment of the RMSS Software including Custom
Modifications and Base Modifications, if any one or more of the provisions
contained herein shall for any reason be held to be unenforceable in any
respect under law, such unenforceability shall not affect any other provision
of this Agreement, but this Agreement shall be construed as if such
unenforceable provision or provisions had never been contained herein, provided
that the removal of such offending term or provision does not materially alter
the burdens or benefits of either of the parties under this Agreement or any Exhibit or
Schedule, in which case the unenforceable portion shall be replaced by one that
reflects the parties original intent as closely as possible while remaining
enforceable.





17.3        Third Party Beneficiaries.  Except as set forth herein, the provisions of this Agreement are for
the benefit of the parties and not for any other person. Should any third party
institute proceedings, this Agreement shall not provide any such





17




















person with any remedy, claim, liability,
reimbursement, cause of action, or other right.





17.4        Governing Law; Forum Selection;
Consent of Jurisdiction.  This Agreement will be governed by and
construed under the laws of the State of Florida, USA, without regard to
principles of conflict of laws. The parties agree that the only circumstance in
which disputes between them, not otherwise excepted from the resolution process
described in Section 11, will not be subject to the provisions of Section 11
is where a party makes a good faith determination that a breach of the terms of
this Agreement by the other party requires prompt and equitable relief. Each of
the parties submits to the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court
sitting in Jacksonville, Florida with respect to such judicial proceedings.
Each of the parties waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance
of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety or to other
security that might be required of any party with respect thereto. Any party
may make service on the other party by sending or delivering a copy of the
process to the party to be served at the address set forth in Section 15
above. Nothing in this Section, however, shall affect the right of any party to
serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law or in equity. Each
party agrees that a final judgment in any action or proceeding so brought shall
be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by law or in equity.





17.5        Executed in Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be
an original, but such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the
same document.





17.6        Construction.  The headings and numbering of sections in this Agreement are for
convenience only and shall not be construed to define or limit any of the terms
or affect the scope, meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or the
particular section to which they relate. This Agreement and the provisions
contained herein shall not be construed or interpreted for or against any party
because that party drafted or caused its legal representative to draft any of
its provisions.





17.7        Entire Agreement.  This Agreement, including the Exhibits and Schedules attached hereto
and the agreements referenced herein constitute the entire agreement between
the parties, and supersedes all prior oral or written agreements,
representations, statements, negotiations, understandings, proposals, marketing
brochures, correspondence and undertakings related thereto.  Without
limiting the foregoing, the parties expressly acknowledge that this Agreement,
together with the Exhibits and Schedules hereto, is intended to amend and
restate the Prior License Agreement in its entirety, and upon the effectiveness
of this Agreement, the Prior License Agreement shall be deemed to have been
superseded and replaced in its entirety by this Agreement.





18




















17.8        Amendments and Waivers.  This Agreement may be amended only by written agreement signed by duly
authorized representatives of each party. No waiver of any provisions of this Agreement
and no consent to any default under this Agreement shall be effective unless
the same shall be in writing and signed by or on behalf of both parties. No
course of dealing or failure of any party to strictly enforce any term, right
or condition of this Agreement shall be construed as a waiver of such term,
right or condition. Waiver by either party of any default by the other party
shall not be deemed a waiver of any other default.





17.9        Remedies Cumulative.  Unless otherwise provided for under this Agreement, all rights of
termination or cancellation, or other remedies set forth in this Agreement, are
cumulative and are not intended to be exclusive of other remedies to which the
injured party may be entitled by law or equity in case of any breach or
threatened breach by the other party of any provision in this Agreement. Use of
one or more remedies shall not bar use of any other remedy for the purpose of
enforcing any provision of this Agreement.





17.10      Taxes.  All charges and fees to be paid under this Agreement are exclusive of
any applicable sales, use, service or similar tax which may be assessed
currently or in the future on the RMSS Software or related services provided
under this Agreement. If a sales, use, services or a similar tax is assessed on
the RMSS Software or related services provided to Licensee under this
Agreement, Licensee will pay directly, reimburse or indemnify RMSS for such
taxes as well as any applicable interest and penalties. Licensee shall pay such
taxes in addition to the sums otherwise due under this Agreement. RMSS shall,
to the extent it is aware of taxes, itemize them on a proper VAT, GST or other
invoice submitted pursuant to this Agreement. All property, employment and
income taxes based on the assets, employees and net income, respectively, of
RMSS shall be RMSS’s sole responsibility. The parties will cooperate with each
other in determining the extent to which any tax is due and owing under the
circumstances and shall provide and make available to each other any withholding
certificates, information regarding the location of use of the RMSS Software or
provision of the services or sale and any other exemption certificates or
information reasonably requested by either party.





17.11      Press Releases.  The parties shall consult with each other in preparing any press
release, public announcement, news media response or other form of release of
information concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
that is intended to provide such information to the news media or the public (a
“Press Release”). Neither party shall issue or cause the publication of any
such Press Release without the prior written consent of the other party; except
that nothing herein will prohibit either party from issuing or causing publication
of any such Press Release to the extent that such action is required by
applicable law or the rules of any national stock exchange applicable to
such party or its affiliates, in which case the party wishing to make such
disclosure will, if practicable under





19




















the circumstances, notify the other party of the
proposed time of issuance of such Press Release and consult with and allow the
other party reasonable time to comment on such Press Release in advance of its
issuance.

Agreement shall become effective as of the date and time that the Merger
becomes effective pursuant to the terms of the Certegy Merger Agreement.

their duly authorized representatives.

Exhibit J


DELL SERVICE & SUPPORT SCHEDULE
FOR ENABLED PRODUCTS

Customer Entitlement to
Altiris Technical Support

Altiris provides support to its customers
according to the support descriptions found in the current “Altiris Support Offerings” document. Refer to that document for current, detailed descriptions of the services offered.

Altiris provides Online Support to all customers and potential customers using Altiris
software. Online support includes a knowledge base and online support forum that contains many discussions about issues and solutions. Issues and solutions pertaining to the Altiris software and its operation on Dell hardware may be found and logged
through Altiris Online Support.

If customers would like to speak directly with
an Altiris Support representative, or would like to communicate directly via email, a support contract with Altiris must be purchased. Altiris offers several fee-based support services from incident-based support to Premium 7x24 support, to Assigned
or Dedicated Support Engineer service. Altiris screens all customer calls and emails to ensure that they have a support contract in place before Altiris provides on-to-one assistance per the contract.

Dell sales personnel must be aware of the Altiris support policies and will sell the proper
Altiris support contract based upon the needs of the customer. The customer will then be empowered to contact Altiris directly, or may choose to contact Dell directly if they feel that the issue is related to Dell hardware or software.


Resolution of a Customer Case

Dell and Altiris shall endeavor to respond to, and use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide case remedies in a timely manner in accordance with the priority level identified in Table 1, and in accordance with that party’s support or maintenance agreement with such mutual customer. Dell will use every effort available to
resolve issues involving Dell hardware and Altiris software.

Customers with an
issue involving Altiris products should direct their call to Altiris support per the details outlined in their support contract. Altiris will provide all levels of support and fulfillment for Altiris-manufactured products based upon the support
agreement that the customer has in place.

If a customer places an initial call
to a Dell call center, the Dell representative will work with the customer to ensure that Dell product is not the root cause of the issue. Dell may engage Altiris (warm transfer) on the behalf of the Mutual Customer. Altiris will assist the customer
as outlined in the then-current support agreement. Customers may be transferred to 801-805-2795 for technical support. An Altiris Customer Service Representative will answer the call and ensure that the customer’s support entitlement is
verified and that the proper support technician is reached.

In cases where the
root cause of the issue has not been determined, Altiris and Dell will work cooperatively until the issue has been resolved, or the root cause of the issue has been determined to be generated by one of the manufacturer’s products.


Partnership on Escalated Issues

In certain cases the customer may lack a clear understanding whether the issue lies with
Altiris or Dell. In cases such as these, Dell and Altiris will work jointly to resolve the issue.

Qualified Experts

In cases where
Altiris and Dell are working together to resolve Severity 1 issues, both parties will provide real-time, qualified experts to work until resolution of the escalated issue has been met.







A qualified expert for Dell is defined as a Level 2 or higher technical support representative. A qualified expert for
Altiris is defined as a Product Specialist or higher support representative. The qualified experts from Dell and Altiris will work seamlessly on the phone until the Severity 1 issue has been resolved or a suitable alternative solution can be agreed
upon. In critical situations involving lengthy, real-time escalations, Dell and Altiris will provide the proper transition from expert to expert. Dell and Altiris will ensure that there are no delays in resolving the Severity 1 customer issue by
seamlessly moving new experts onto the call to provide proper issue transition to the new expert (up to two hours) before the original expert’s shift ends.

Engineering Contacts


As a part of Severity 1 issue handling, Altiris will provide engineering
contacts for Dell’s Global Product Support Engineering team. Dell will also provide engineering contacts to Altiris for issues that involve Dell products under the same guidelines (long term sustaining issues).

Root Cause Analysis

Requests from the customer for root cause analysis shall be completed within ten (10) business days (on average) by Dell and Altiris.


Setting Severities

Because of the critical nature of the products supported in this agreement, the customer
will set the severity of the issue. Dell representatives will work with the customer to help the customer understand and set the appropriate severity level of the issue.

Depending on the issue’s severity, Dell and Altiris will agree to move the escalated issues to the needed level.

Dell and Altiris will communicate escalations using the following severity level definitions:

Time in Severity (TIS)


Dell and Altiris will work towards a mutual Time In Severity (TIS) goal. TIS
is Dell Enterprise Services’ key customer experience metric. TIS is defined as the duration the case spent in each pre-defined severity from the time the case was issued until the case is considered closed.

The following algorithms and goals will be used to measure TIS:

Table 3: TIS Algorithms



Severity

Calculation

TIS Goal Average


SEV 1-A	  	(Timestamp of close or severity change – Timestamp of Sev 1-A issued) – (Customer Time)	  	12

SEV 2	  	(Timestamp of close or severity change – Timestamp of Sev 2 issued) – (Customer Time)	  	24
SEV 3	  	(Timestamp of close or severity change – Timestamp of Sev 3 issued) – (Customer Time)	  	36








Customer Time is defined as: Time the customer defers or requests Dell to monitor after resolution has been provided.
(i.e. Customer issue has been resolved, but customer would like us to monitor the case for the next 2 weeks)

On-Site Assistance

If the need arises for on-site assistance, Dell will move experts on-site with a goal of 4 hours. Altiris will provide on-site assistance as outlined in the customer’s Altiris support contract. In Severity 1-A or
Severity 1 cases, Altiris and Dell may mutually agree that an on-site visit is required, at which time the terms of that site visit will be discussed and agreed upon. Once Dell and Altiris agree that on-site assistance is necessary, representatives
from both parties will agree on a reasonable time frame to move an Altiris expert onsite. In cases where Dell or Altiris does not have personnel within a 125 mile radius of the area, personnel will be flown in upon joint agreement that an on-site
visit is warranted. Due to the critical nature of these escalations, Dell and Altiris will jointly determine the owner of the associated costs (if any) with the on-site visit after the incident is closed.

Severity 1 and Severity 1-A Issues

Altiris and Dell will provide 7x24 original ownership on all Sev 1-A and Sev 1 issues. Both
Dell and Altiris will provide single points of contacts on all Severity 1-A and Severity 1 issues. Dell utilizes a Technical Account Manager as the single point of contact for areas involving severe escalations. Altiris utilizes a Support Manager as
the single point of contact for issues involving severe escalations.

Partner Escalation Manager

Should any escalation or
engagement procedures fail, Dell’s Partner Escalation Manager will engage Altiris representatives to jointly resolve any issues.

EXHIBIT 10.32

SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT

This Software License Agreement is made as of this 8th day of November,
1999,  between Preferred Voice,  Inc., a Delaware  corporation  (""Licensor"") and
Midwest Wireless Communications L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company, on
behalf of itself and its wholly owned subsidiaries and affiliates  (""Licensee"").
Licensor  and  Licensee are  collectively  referred to in this  Agreement as the
""Parties.""

Background Information

Licensor has developed a system (the ""System"") that when interconnected
with a telephone  switching  system is capable of  performing  the services (the
""Services"")  described in a Marketing Agreement between Licensor and Licensee of
even date (the  ""Marketing  Agreement"").  Each System  consists of the hardware,
certain  third  party   software  (the  ""Third  Party   Software"")  and  certain
proprietary   application  software  developed  by  Licensor  (the  ""Application
Software"").  Licensee  is a licensed  provider of  wireless  telephony  and data
services in the calling areas described in the Marketing Agreement (the ""Service
Areas"").  Licensee wishes to offer the Services to end users (""End Users"") under
its own brand in conjunction with its telecommunications  services, and Licensor
has  agreed to  install  its  System in  Licensee's  location  for that  purpose
pursuant to the Marketing Agreement.

In  consideration  of the  mutual  promises  made  in  this  Agreement,
Licensor and Licensee  agree that the terms and  conditions set forth as follows
will apply to the license of Application Software.

ARTICLE 1. LICENSE AND PROCUREMENT

1.01 License.  Pursuant to this  Agreement,  Licensor  hereby grants to
Licensee  a  nontransferable,  non-exclusive  license  to  use  the  Application
Software, together with all subsequent improvements thereto in the Service Area.

1.02 Term. The initial term of this Agreement shall be co-terminus with
the Marketing Agreement.

ARTICLE 2. LIMITATIONS ON USE

2.01  General  Use.  Licensee  agrees to use the  Application  Software
solely to provide the  Services  to End Users.  Licensee  may private  brand the
Services it offers.

2.02     Location.

(a) Use of Application Software.  The Application Software may
be used only on the hardware  provided by Licensor  (""Designated  Hardware"")  at
Licensee's switch locations in the Licensed Areas.


SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT - Page 1



<PAGE>



(b) Temporary  Use of  Non-Designated  Hardware.  Licensee may
temporarily  install and use the  Application  Software  on hardware  other than
Designated Hardware,  but only if the Designated Hardware cannot be used because
of  hardware,  software  or other  malfunction  and only  until  the  Designated
Hardware  is  returned  to  operation.  Licensee  shall not  install  or use the
Application  Software on such  replacement  hardware  without  the prior  verbal
consent of Licensor.  Licensor shall not  unreasonably  withhold this consent if
the proposed  replacement  hardware meets or exceeds the  Specifications for the
Designated Hardware.

2.03  Copies.  Licensee may make one ""backup  copy"" of the  Application
Software for archival  purposes at each location;  any such archival copy may be
stored at the location  where the products are installed and  operational  or at
any such reputable off-site storage facility or facilities,  as the case may be,
which Licensee, in its reasonable judgment, shall select to maintain and protect
such  archival  copy for  purposes  of  disaster  recovery.  Licensee  shall not
otherwise  copy any  portion of the  Software,  except as  necessary  to use the
Application  Software,  solely as permitted in this  Agreement.  Licensee  shall
reproduce and include  Licensors  applicable  copyright  notice,  patent notice,
trademark, or service mark on any copies of the Application Software.

ARTICLE 3. PROPERTY RIGHTS

3.01 Title to Software.  Title to the Application  Software is reserved
for Licensor. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that Licensor is and shall remain
the owner of the  Application  Software  and shall be the owner of all copies of
the Application Software made by Licensee.

3.02  Confidentiality  of  Software.  Licensee  acknowledges  that  the
Application  Software is confidential in nature and that Licensor considers it a
trade  secret  belonging to Licensor.  Licensee  agrees to hold the  Application
Software in confidence for Licensor and not to sell, rent, license,  distribute,
transfer,  or  disclose  the  Application  Software or its  contents,  including
methods or ideas used in the Application Software, to anyone except to employees
or third party  consultants  of Licensee  when  disclosure  to employees or such
third  party  consultants  is  necessary  to use  the  license  granted  in this
Agreement.  Licensee shall instruct all employees and third party consultants to
whom any such  disclosure is made that the disclosure is  confidential  and that
the employee must keep the Application  Software  confidential by using the same
care and  discretion  that they use with other data  designated  by  Licensee as
confidential.  The  confidentiality  requirements  of this  Section  shall be in
effect both during the term of this  Agreement and after it is terminated  for a
period of three (3) years,  provided,  that the foregoing restrictions shall not
apply to  information:  (a)  generally  known to the public or  obtainable  from
public  sources;  (b) readily  apparent  from the  keyboard  operations,  visual
display,  or output reports of the Application  Software;  (c) previously in the
possession of Licensee or subsequently developed or acquired without reliance on
the  Application  Software;  or (d)  approved  by Licensor  for release  without
restrictions on use and disclosure similar to those found in this Agreement.

3.03 Security.  Licensee agrees to keep the Software in a secure place,
under  access  and use  restrictions  designated  to prevent  disclosure  of the
Software to  unauthorized  persons.  Licensee  agrees to at least  implement the
security  precautions  that it  normally  uses to protect  its own  confidential
materials and trade secrets.

SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT - Page 2



<PAGE>




3.04  Disclosure as Breach.  Licensee agrees that any disclosure of the
Software to a third  party,  except as set forth above,  constitutes  a material
breach of this  Agreement,  entitling  Licensor to the  benefit of Section  5.01
hereof.

3.05 Removal of Markings.  Licensee agrees not to remove,  mutilate, or
destroy any copyright, patent notice, trademark, service mark, other proprietary
markings, or confidential legends placed on or within the Software.

ARTICLE 4. WARRANTY PROVISIONS

4.01     Warranties

(a) General.  Licensor  warrants that (i) it has good title to
the  Application  Software and the right to license its use to Licensee  free of
any proprietary  rights,  liens,  or  encumbrances of any other party,  (ii) the
Application  Software  will permit the System to provide  Services when properly
interconnected  to Licensee's  functioning  switches  described in the Marketing
Agreement (provided,  that ANY MODIFICATION OF THE APPLICATION  SOFTWARE. BY ANY
PERSONS OTHER THAN LICENSOR SHALL VOID THE WARRANTY IN THIS CLAUSE (ii)),  (iii)
commencing on installation thereof, and for a period of one (1) year thereafter,
(1) the Software shall be free of viruses,  bugs or contaminants which may cause
damage to Licensee's  systems or interrupt  Licensee's  utilization of a System;
and (2) the media in which the Software is  contained  shall be free of material
defects in materials or workmanship.

b. Year 2000. Licensor warrants that the Application  Software
delivered  or modified by Licensor is Year 2000  Compliant  (as defined  below).
Year 2000 Compliant  software that is intended to interoperate  with third party
products (including Third Party Software) as described herein will be compatible
and inter-operate in such manner as to process between them, as applicable, date
related data correctly as described in the definition of ""Year 2000  Compliant.""
Except  as  set  forth  in the  preceding  sentence,  (i)  Licensor  assumes  no
responsibilities  or  obligations to cause third party products to function with
the  Application  Software;  and (ii)  Licensor  will not be in  breach  of this
warranty for any failure of the  Application  Software to be Year 2000 Compliant
if such failure results from the inability of any software, hardware, or systems
of Licensee or any third party to be Year 2000 Compliant.  ""Year 2000 Compliant""
means that (a) neither the  performance  nor  functionality  of the  Application
Software will be affected by dates prior to, during and after the year 2000, (b)
no value for current date will cause any  interruption  in the  operation of the
Application Software; (c) the year 2000 is recognized as a leap year; (d) in all
interfaces  and data  storage the  century,  in any date,  is  specified  either
explicitly or by unambiguous algorithms or inferencing rules; and (e) date-based
functionality of the Application  Software behaves and will behave  consistently
for dates prior to, during and after the year 2000.

4.02  Remedies.  In the  event of any  nonconformity  or  defect in the
Application  Software  (or any other  breach with  respect to the  condition  or
operation  of the  Application  Software)  for which  Licensor  is  responsible,
Licensor shall, during the foregoing  respective  warranty periods,  (A) provide
reasonable efforts to correct or cure such nonconformity, defect, contaminant or
breach

SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT - Page 3



<PAGE>



(which may include a workaround for system errors),  (13) at Licensor's  option,
replace the  relevant  part of the  Application  Software in lieu of curing such
nonconformity, defect, contaminant or breach, or (C) if Licensor determines that
neither of the  foregoing  is  commercially  practicable,  remove the System and
terminate the Marketing Agreement and this License Agreement.

4.03 Warranty  Disclaimer.  LICENSOR DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT
ALL ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED. LICENSEE AGREES THAT LICENSEE'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE
REMEDY  FOR THE  DEFECTS  DESCRIBED  IN THIS  SECTION  SHALL BE  LIMITED  TO THE
CORRECTIVE ACTION DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION. THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN
THIS AGREEMENT ARE IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING
ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

4.04  Limitation  of  Remedies.  LICENSEE  AGREES  THAT  ITS  EXCLUSIVE
REMEDIES,  AND LICENSORS ENTIRE LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE IS AS SET
FORTH IN THIS  AGREEMENT.  LICENSEE  FURTHER  AGREES THAT LICENSOR  SHALL NOT BE
LIABLE TO LICENSEE FOR ANY INDIRECT  DAMAGES,  INCLUDING ANY LOST PROFITS,  LOST
SAVINGS, OR OTHER INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, ARISING OUT OF ITS USE OR
INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE OR THE BREACH OF ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED  WARRANTY,
EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 4.05.

4.05     Indemnification.

(a)  Infringement.  Licensor  agrees  to  indemnify  and  hold
Licensee and its directors, officers, employees and agents, harmless against any
and all claims, demands, actions, losses, liabilities,  judgments,  settlements,
awards  and  costs   (including   reasonable   attorneys'   fees  and  expenses)
(collectively,  ""Liabilities"")  arising  out of or related to any claim  against
Licensee by a third party that  Licensee's use or possession of the  Application
Software (or the license  granted to Licensee  hereunder with respect  thereto),
infringes or violates any United States patent,  copyright or other  proprietary
right of any third party; provided that Licensee gives Licensor prompt notice of
any such  claim of  which it has  actual  knowledge  and  cooperates  fully,  at
Licensor's expense,  with Licensor in the defense of such claim.  Licensor shall
have the exclusive right to defend and settle at its sole discretion and expense
all suits or proceedings  arising out of the foregoing.  Licensee shall not have
the right to settle any action,  claim or  threatened  action  without the prior
written  consent of Licensor (at Licensor's  sole and absolute  discretion).  In
case use of the  Application  Software  is  forbidden  by a court  of  competent
jurisdiction because of proprietary  infringement,  Licensor shall promptly,  at
its  option,  (i)  procure  for  Licensee  the  rights  to  continue  using  the
Application  Software;  (ii) replace the  infringing  Application  Software with
non-infringing  Application  Software of equal performance and quality which are
materially the functional  equivalent of the  infringing  Application  Software;
(iii) modify the infringing  Application  Software so it becomes  non-infringing
while materially  maintaining the functionality  thereof; or (iv) if none of the
foregoing  are  commercially  practicable,  remove the System and  terminate the
Marketing  Agreement and this License Agreement.  Licensor will then be released
from  any  further  obligation  whatsoever  to  Licensee  with  respect  to  the
infringing  part of the Application  Software.  Nothing in this Section shall be
deemed to make Licensor liable for any patent

SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT - Page 4



<PAGE>



or  copyright  infringement  suits that arise in  connection  with (a)  designs,
modifications,  use,  integration or data furnished by Licensee if  infringement
would have been avoided by not using or combining the Application  Software with
such other  programs or data or (b) if  infringement  would have been avoided by
the use of an updated version made available to Licensee.

(b) Other.  Licensor  agrees to  indemnify  and hold  Licensee
harmless  against any and all  Liabilities  arising out of Licensor's  negligent
acts or omissions, intentional torts, or material breach of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 5. TERMINATION

5.01 Cause for Termination. The license granted in this Agreement shall
terminate  automatically  and  without  further  notice upon the  occurrence  of
expiration of the term,  specified in Section 1.02 or of any renewal term in the
absence of a subsequent  renewal in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
Licensor may terminate this  Agreement in the event that (a) Licensee  discloses
the Software to a third party except as authorized  herein,  whether directly or
indirectly and whether  inadvertently or purposefully,  or (b) Licensee attempts
to use,  copy,  license,  or convey the  Software in any manner  contrary to the
terms of this Agreement or in derogation of Licensors  proprietary rights in the
Application  Software.  In addition,  either party may terminate  this Agreement
(and all licenses granted hereunder) at any time if (a) the other party breaches
any  material  term  hereof  (other than  breaches  by Licensee  pursuant to the
preceding  sentence) or the  Marketing  Agreement  and fails to cure such breach
within 30 days after receipt of written notice,  (b) the other party shall be or
becomes  insolvent,  (c) the other party makes an assignment  for the benefit of
creditors, (d) there are instituted by the other party proceedings in bankruptcy
or under any insolvency or similar law or for  reorganization,  receivership  or
dissolution,  (e) there are  instituted  against the other party  proceedings in
bankruptcy  or  under  any  insolvency  or  similar  law or for  reorganization,
receivership or dissolution, which proceedings are not dismissed within 60 days,
or (f) the  other  party  ceases to do  business.  In the  event  that  Licensor
terminates  this  Agreement  pursuant to this  Section,  Licensor may invoke all
rights Licensor possesses upon termination.

5.02 Effect of Termination.  Licensee agrees that on termination  under
Section 5.01, Licensor may recover all copies of Application  Software that have
been  delivered to or made by Licensee,  and (on  Licensor's  request)  Licensee
shall destroy all copies of the  Application  Software that are not recovered by
Licensor,  certify to Licensor that it has retained no copies of the Application
Software,  and acknowledge  that it may no longer use the Application  Software.
Upon  termination  of the license,  Licensors  obligations  under this Agreement
shall cease.

ARTICLE 6. MISCELLANEOUS

6.01 Governing  Law. THIS AGREEMENT  SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS,  EXCEPT THAT ANY CONFLICTS OF
LAW RULES OR PRINCIPLES  OF THE STATE OF TEXAS THAT WOULD  REQUIRE  REFERENCE TO
THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION SHALL BE DISREGARDED.

<PAGE>



6.02  Headings.  Headings  used in  this  Agreement  are to  facilitate
reference only, are not a part of this Agreement, and will not in any way affect
the  interpretation  hereof.  The  use  herein  of the  word  ""including,""  when
following any general statement, term or matter, shall not be construed to limit
such  statement,  term or  matter to the  specific  items or  matters  set forth
immediately  following such word or to similar items or matters,  whether or not
non-limiting language (such as ""without limitation,"" or ""but not limited to,"" or
words of similar  import) is used with references  thereto,  but rather shall be
deemed to refer to all other  items and  matters,  that  reasonably  could  fall
within the broadest possible scope of such general statement, term or matter.

6.03  Assignment.  This  Agreement,  and  all  rights  and  obligations
hereunder,  are personal as to the parties  hereto and may not be  assigned,  in
whole or in part, by any of the parties to any other person, firm or corporation
without  the prior  written  consent  thereto by the other party  hereto,  which
consent will not be unreasonably  withheld;  except that either party may freely
assign any or all of its rights and obligations  hereunder to any affiliate.  An
affiliate is (a) an entity that owns all or substantially all of the outstanding
stock of the  entity so  assigning,  (b) an entity all or  substantially  all of
whose stock is owned by the entity so  assigning,  or (c) an entity under common
ownership with the entity so assigning.  Such assignee entity shall thereupon be
free to assign the  rights and  obligations  under this  Agreement  to any other
affiliate.  Any  assignment  contrary to the terms hereof shall be null and void
and of no force or effect.

6.04 Failure or Partial Exercises.  No failure on the part of any party
to exercise,  and no delay in exercising,  any right or remedy  hereunder  shall
operate as a waiver  thereof.  Nor shall any single or partial  exercise  of any
right or remedy  hereunder  exclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right hereunder.

6.05 Entire Agreement, Amendments. This Agreement and all schedules and
exhibits  annexed  hereto  constitute  the entire  agreement  among the  parties
respecting the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior  agreements  among
the parties  relative to the subject matter hereof.  In entering this Agreement,
Licensee did not rely on any  representations  or  warranties of Licensor or its
employees or agents other than those set forth in this Agreement. This Agreement
may not be  modified  or amended  except by a writing  that states that it is an
amendment   to  this   Agreement   and  which  is  signed  by  duly   authorized
representative of the parties.

6.06 Notices.  All notices  required or permitted to be given hereunder
shall be in writing and shall be valid and  sufficient if dispatched  either (i)

is held to be illegal,  invalid,  or unenforceable  under present or future laws
effective  during the term of this Agreement,  then and in that event, it is the
intention of the parties hereto that the remainder of this  Agreement  shall not
be  affected  thereby,  and it is also  the  intention  of the  parties  to this
Agreement  that in lieu of each clause or  provision of this  Agreement  that is

<PAGE>

2.8 Bankruptcy Provision

licenses granted to Primus KK under or pursuant to this Agreement are, and will
otherwise be deemed to be, licenses of rights to ""intellectual property"" as
defined under Section 101 of Title 11, United States Code (the ""Bankruptcy
Code""). The parties agree that Primus KK, as a licensee of such rights under
this Agreement will retain and may fully exercise all of its rights and
elections under the Bankruptcy Code. Primus HQ acknowledges that if Primus HQ as
a debtor in possession, or a trustee in bankruptcy in the case under the

Primus KK may elect to retain its rights under such licenses as provided in
Section 365(n) of the Bankruptcy Code. The parties also agree that, after the
commencement of a case under the Bankruptcy Code by or against Primus HQ and
unless and until the licenses granted herein are terminated or expired, upon

shall be increased to such amount where the amount payable to Primus HQ net of
such withheld taxes equals the amounts specified in this Section 3.

Section 4. Proprietary Rights

4.l Ownership

(a) Primus KK acknowledges that the Licensed Software involves valuable
copyright, trade secret and other proprietary rights of Primus HQ. No title to

a result, Primus HQ agrees not to challenge or assist any other party in
challenging the validity of, or Primus KK's rights in, the Improvements or any
applications to register any copyrights, patents, or other intellectual property

applications to register any copyrights, patents or other intellectual property
rights related to the Improvements.

the Primus Marks in connection with the marketing and usage of the Licensed
Software upon written notice to Primus HQ. After a surrendering of the usage or
upon expiration of the Primus Marks Usage Period, Primus KK shall re-brand the

Unauthorized Use of the Source Code, (iii) precludes such person from
disclosing the Source Code to any third party, and (iv) precludes such

Software in the possession or control of the person or entity engaging in such
Unauthorized Use. Primus KK will immediately notify Primus HQ of any legal
proceeding initiated by Primus KK in connection with such Unauthorized Use.
Primus HQ may, at its option and expense, assume control of any such proceeding.
If Primus HQ assumes such control, Primus HQ will have exclusive control over
the prosecution and settlement of the proceeding, Primus KK will provide such
assistance related to such proceeding as Primus HQ may reasonably request, and
Primus KK will assist Primus HQ in enforcing any settlement or order made in
connection with such proceeding.

this Agreement will not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment to any extent
of such party's right to assert or rely upon any such provisions, rights or
remedies in that or any other instance; rather, the same will be and remain in
full force and effect.

8.4 Entire Agreement

This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement, and supersedes any and all prior
agreements, among the parties with regard to the subject matter hereof. No
amendment, modification or waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement
will be valid unless set forth in a written instrument signed by the party to be
bound thereby. Any remedy of Primus HQ set forth in this Agreement is in
addition to any other remedy afforded to Primus HQ under any other contract, by
law or otherwise. The distribution agreement between the parties and all
subsequent amendments thereto is hereby terminated and of no further force or
effect.

8.5 Assignment

(a) Primus KK will not assign all or any part of this Agreement or any of its
rights hereunder without the prior written consent of Primus HQ; provided,
however, that no consent of Primus HQ


<PAGE>

shall be required to assign this Agreement and the licenses granted hereunder to
TCI or its controlled Affiliate (but not to any Affiliate that is part of a
joint venture with any company that is a direct competitor to Primus HQ or its
successor) provided that such assignee agrees in writing to assume and comply
with the terms of this Agreement and that such assignee shall not have the right
thereafter to assign or transfer this Agreement or the license to any other
third party other than to TCI or one of its controlled Affiliates.

(b) Subject to the foregoing restriction on assignments, this Agreement will be
fully binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties
hereto and their respective successors, legal representatives and assigns. The
parties shall cause their successors, legal representatives and assigns, whether
created voluntarily or by operation of law and including without limitation
those resulting from merger, acquisition, consolidation or other like events (a
""Successor-in-Interest""), to perform their respective obligations under this
Agreement. In the event that either party should engage in negotiations with a
Successor-in-Interest, that party shall promptly and completely disclose the
terms of this Agreement to the third party, and the disclosing party shall take
all necessary steps to ensure the assumption of and compliance with all terms of
this Agreement by that party's Successor-in-Interest. Upon the request of the
other party, a party so engaged in potential succession or merger negotiations
shall provide the requesting party with written assurances of the negotiating
party's compliance with this Section.

8.6 Unenforceable Provisions

The invalidity or unenforceability of any of the provisions of this Agreement
will not affect the other provisions hereof, and this Agreement will be
construed in all respects as if such invalid or unenforceable provision were
replaced with a valid and enforceable provision as similar as possible to the
one replaced.

8.7 Survival

Sections 4, 6 and 7.1 and all other provisions of this Agreement which may
reasonably be interpreted or construed as surviving the expiration or
termination of the Term, will survive the expiration or termination of the Term.

8.8 Forum Selection

enforce the provisions of this Agreement, or otherwise arising under or by
reason of this Agreement, other than in the federal and state courts located in

jurisdiction and venue of such courts with regard to any suit, proceeding or
claim to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, or otherwise arising under or
by reason of this Agreement.

This Agreement will be interpreted, construed and enforced in all respects in
accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, U.S.A, without reference to
its choice of law principles. The provisions of the 1980 U.N. Convention on

immediately due and enforceable in equity upon any of these circumstances:





(a)                                  RMSS has given
notice to Licensee under terms of Maintenance that RMSS shall cease, or RMSS

or separable component of





4




















RMSS Software, the duty of
Source Code delivery shall be limited to the Source Code for such specific
module or separable component.





(d)                                 Licensee shall
have requested development or integration services with respect to RMSS
Software which RMSS is unable or unwilling to provide or as to which the
parties cannot timely come to commercial terms.





(i)                                     To the extent
the integration or development relates to a specific module or separable
component of RMSS Software, the duty of Source Code delivery shall be limited
to the Source Code for such specific module or separable component.





(ii)                                  In the event of
delivery of Source Code by RMSS under this subsection (d), upon Licensee’s

same scope of work that RMSS was requested to perform but did not perform, it
will provide to RMSS a copy of the source code for the development or
enhancement, including any annotations therein, certifying same as complete and

following the delivery by Licensee to RMSS of source code for Licensee’s developments

Solutions Software Development and Property Allocation Agreement dated as of November 22,
2005 is not completed on the scheduled completion date and Accepted under the
terms of that agreement, and in such event, the RMSS’ request for certification

right to obtain access to Source Code pursuant to this Section 3.2(d) may
be invoked at any time and from time to time, regardless of the continuity of
Maintenance.

5.1                                 The term of
license shall be perpetual subject to termination in accordance with the terms
herein.





5.2                                 Licensee may
terminate the license for convenience upon no less than ninety (90) Days prior
written notice to RMSS.





5.3                                 A license
enjoyed by a Subsidiary of Licensee shall terminate without further formality
upon such entity’s ceasing to be a Subsidiary of Licensee.  A license enjoyed by a Subsidiary of Licensee
shall terminate without further formality upon the six month anniversary date
after such entity’s ceasing to be a Subsidiary of Licensee.  Prior to such Subsidiary ceasing to be a
Subsidiary of Licensee, Licensee shall cause such Subsidiary to agree to
migrate its data off the RMSS Software and on to an alternative product during
the above described six month period.  In
any event, if the Subsidiary becomes a Subsidiary of a Competitor, the license
to the Subsidiary shall terminate immediately.





5.4                                 In the event
Licensee or a Licensee Subsidiary discloses any of the RMSS Software or any
material part of the Documentation to a Competitor, then RMSS upon thirty Days
prior written notice to Licensee, may terminate the license with respect to
that portion relating to the RMSS Software and Documentation provided to such Competitor
if Licensee on its own does not (or if Licensee does not cause its Subsidiary
to) discontinue disclosure of the RMSS Software and Documentation to such
Competitor within thirty Days following Licensee’s receipt of RMSS’ written
notice.  Any such termination shall be
effective upon the expiration of the cure period.  The foregoing is intended to apply only to
the remedy of termination.  RMSS shall retain the right to pursue any other
remedies in the event Licensee or its Subsidiary makes an unauthorized
disclosure to a Competitor, including injunctive relief or recovery of damages,
and, depending on the nature of the disclosure, requesting that Licensee
undertake other measures in addition to simply discontinuing
disclosure to the Competitor.





5.5                                 In the event of
termination of the license for any reason, Licensee and/or its Subsidiary, as
applicable, shall promptly cease all use of the relevant RMSS Software, delete
from its systems all copies of the relevant RMSS Software, and within thirty
(30) Days of termination, return to RMSS all tangible copies of the relevant
RMSS Software, together with certification that is has ceased such use, deleted
such copies and returned such tangible copies as required hereunder.





5.6                                 Each party
acknowledges and agrees that, in the event of Licensee’s breach or threatened
breach or any provision of Sections 4, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5 or 7, RMSS shall have no
adequate remedy in damages and notwithstanding the dispute resolution
provisions in Section 11 hereof, is entitled to seek an injunction to
prevent such breach or threatened breach; provided, however, no specification
of a particular





7




















legal
or equitable remedy is to be construed as a waiver, prohibition, or limitation
of any legal or equitable remedies in the event of a breach hereof.





6.                                      INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.





6.1                               Ownership
of RMSS Software and Documentation.  From the date
the RMSS Software and Documentation is first disclosed to Licensee, and at all
times thereafter, as between the parties, RMSS and its licensors shall be the
sole and exclusive owners of all right, title, and interest in and to the RMSS
Software, Documentation and all Modifications, including, without limitation,
all intellectual property and other rights related thereto. The parties
acknowledge that this Agreement in no way limits or restricts RMSS and the RMSS
Subsidiaries from developing or marketing on their own or for any third party
in the United States or any other country, the RMSS Software, Documentation or
Modifications, or any similar software (including, but not limited to, any
modification, enhancement, interface, upgrade, change and all software, source
code, blueprints, diagrams, flow charts, specifications, functional
descriptions or training materials relating thereto) without payment of any
compensation to Licensee, or any notice to Licensee.





6.2                               Development
Services.  Licensee may
from time to time wish to augment the RMSS product with additional
functionality or utility, or to integrate it with Licensee systems from other
sources, and for such purposes may request the provision of development
services from RMSS.





7.                                      CONFIDENTIALITY.





7.1                               Confidentiality Obligation.  Proprietary Information (i) shall be deemed the property of the
disclosing party (or the party for whom such data was collected or processed,
if any), (ii) shall be used solely for the purposes of administering and
otherwise implementing the terms of this Agreement and any ancillary
agreements, and (iii) shall be protected by the receiving party in
accordance with the terms of this Section 7.





7.2                               Non-Disclosure Covenant.  Except as set forth in this Section, neither party shall disclose the
Proprietary Information of the other party in whole or in part, including
derivations, to any third party. If the parties agree to a specific
nondisclosure period for a specific document, the disclosing party shall mark the
document with that nondisclosure period. In the absence of a specific period,
the duty of confidentiality for (a) RMSS Software, Source Code and related
Documentation shall extend in perpetuity and (b) with respect to any other
Proprietary Information shall extend for a period of (5) five years from
disclosure. Proprietary Information shall be held in confidence by the
receiving party and its employees, and shall be disclosed to only those of the
receiving party’s employees and professional advisors who have a need for it in
connection with the administration and implementation of this Agreement. In no
event shall Licensee disclose RMSS





8




















Proprietary Information to a Competitor of RMSS.
Each party shall use the same degree of care and afford the same protections to
the Proprietary Information of the other party as it uses and affords to its
own Proprietary Information.





7.3                               Exceptions.  Proprietary Information shall not be deemed proprietary and, subject to
the carve-out below, the receiving party shall have no obligation of
nondisclosure with respect to any such information which:





(i)                                     is or becomes
publicly known through no wrongful act, fault or negligence of the receiving
party;





(ii)                                  was disclosed to the receiving party by a
third party that was free of obligations of confidentiality to the party
providing the information;





(iii)                               is approved for release by written
authorization of the disclosing party;





(iv)                              was known to the receiving party prior to
receipt of the information;





(v)                                 was independently developed by the receiving
party without access to or use of the Proprietary Information of the disclosing
party; or





(vi)                              is publicly disclosed pursuant to a
requirement or request of a governmental agency, or disclosure is required by
operation of law.





Notwithstanding application of any of the foregoing
exceptions, in no event shall RMSS treat as other than Proprietary Information,
information comprising nonpublic personal information under the GLB Act.





7.4                               Confidentiality of this
Agreement; Protective Arrangements.





(a)                                  The parties acknowledge that this Agreement
contains confidential information that may be considered proprietary by one or
both of the parties, and agree to limit distribution of this Agreement to those
employees of Licensee and RMSS with a need to know the contents of this
Agreement or as required by law or national stock exchange rule. In no event
may this Agreement be reproduced or copies shown to any third parties (except
counsel, auditors and professional advisors) without the prior written consent
of the other party, except as may be necessary by reason of legal, accounting,
tax or regulatory requirements, in which event Licensee and RMSS agree to
exercise reasonable diligence in limiting such disclosure to the minimum
necessary under the particular circumstances.





(b)                                 In addition, each party shall give notice to
the other party of any demands to disclose or provide Proprietary Information
of the other party under or pursuant to lawful process prior to disclosing or
furnishing such Proprietary Information, and shall cooperate in seeking
reasonable protective arrangements.

8.                                      CONTINUING UNDERTAKINGS.





During the duration of the license granted
hereunder, RMSS shall offer Maintenance for the RMSS Software for the fees set

Licensee shall pay RMSS the invoiced amount in full on or prior to thirty (30)

within such period that it is in good faith disputing RMSS’s invoice. Licensee
shall make all payments to RMSS by check, credit card or wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated by RMSS. Payment in full shall not preclude later dispute of
charges or adjustment of improper payments.





9.2                               Past Due Amounts.  Any

subject to interest on the overdue balance at a rate equal to the prime rate as
published in the table money rates in the Wall Street Journal on the date of
payment (or the prior date on which the Wall Street Journal was published if
not published on the date of payment), plus one percent from the due date,
until paid, applied to the outstanding balance from time to time. Any amount
paid but later deemed not to have been due, will be repaid or credited with
interest on the same terms.

RMSS or a RMSS Subsidiary, such Assistance shall be provided pursuant to
separate agreement.





11.                               DISPUTE RESOLUTION.





11.1                        Dispute Resolution Procedures.  If, prior to the termination of this Agreement or the license granted
herein, and prior to notice of termination given by either party to the other,
a dispute arises between RMSS and Licensee with respect to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, or any subject matter governed by this Agreement
(other than disputes regarding a party’s compliance with the provisions





10




















of Sections 4 and/or 7), such dispute shall be
settled as set forth in this Section 11. If either party exercises its
right to initiate the dispute resolution procedures under this Section 11,
then during such procedure any time periods providing for termination of the
Agreement or curing any material breach pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
shall be suspended automatically, except with respect to any termination or
breach arising out of Licensee’s failure to make any undisputed timely and
complete payments to RMSS under this Agreement. At such time as the dispute is
resolved, if such dispute involved the payment of monies, interest at a rate
equal to the prime rate as published in the table money rates in the Wall
Street Journal on the date the dispute is resolved (or the prior date on which
the Wall Street Journal was published if not published on the date the dispute
was resolved) plus one percent for the period of dispute shall be paid to the
party entitled to receive the disputed monies to compensate for the lapsed time
between the date such disputed amount originally was to have been paid (or was
paid) through the date monies are paid (or repaid) in settlement of the
dispute. Disputes arising under Sections 4 or 7 may be resolved by judicial
recourse or in any other manner agreed by the parties.





11.2                        Escalation Procedures.





(a)                                  Each of the
parties shall escalate and negotiate, in good faith, any claim or dispute that
has not been satisfactorily resolved between the parties at the level where the
issue is discovered and has immediate impact (excluding issues of title to work
product, which shall be initially addressed at the general counsel level but
otherwise pursuant to Section 11.2(b) following). To this end, each
party shall escalate any and all unresolved disputes or claims in accordance
with this Section 11.2 at any time to persons responsible for the
administration of the relationship reflected in this SIMON Software License
Agreement. The location, format, frequency, duration and conclusion of these
elevated discussions shall be left to the discretion of the representatives
involved. If such parties do not resolve the underlying dispute within ten (10) Days
of its escalation to them, then either party may notify the other in writing
that he/she desires to elevate the dispute or claim to the President of RMSS
and the President of Licensee or their designated representative(s) for
resolution.





(b)                                 Upon receipt by
a party of a written notice escalating the dispute to the company president
level, the President of RMSS and the President of Licensee or their designated
representative(s) shall promptly communicate with his/her counter party,
negotiate in good faith and use reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute or
claim. The location, format, frequency, duration and conclusion of these
elevated discussions shall be left to the discretion of the representatives
involved. Upon agreement, such representatives may utilize other alternative
dispute resolution procedures to assist in the negotiations. If the parties have
not resolved the dispute





11




















within ten (10) Days after receipt of
the notice elevating the dispute to this level, either may once again escalate
the dispute to binding arbitration.





(c)                                  All discussions
and correspondence among the representatives for purposes of these negotiations
shall be treated as Proprietary Information developed for purposes of
settlement, exempt from discovery and production, which shall not be admissible
in any subsequent proceedings between the parties. Documents identified in or
provided with such communications, which are not prepared for purposes of the
negotiations, are not so exempted and may, if otherwise admissible, be admitted
in evidence in such subsequent proceeding.





11.3                        Arbitration Procedures.  If a claim, controversy or dispute between the parties with respect to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, or any subject matter governed by
this Agreement (and not otherwise excepted), has not been timely resolved
pursuant to the foregoing escalation process, upon notice either party may
initiate binding arbitration of the issue in accordance with the following
procedures.





(a)                                  Either party
may request arbitration by giving the other party written notice to such
effect, which notice shall describe, in reasonable detail, the nature of the
dispute, controversy or claim. Such arbitration shall be governed by the then
current version of the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation
Procedures of the American Arbitration Association. The Arbitration will be
conducted in Jacksonville, Florida in front of one mutually agreed upon
arbitrator.





(b)                                 Each party
shall bear its own fees, costs and expenses of the arbitration and its own
legal expenses, attorneys’ fees and costs of all experts and witnesses. Unless
the award provides otherwise, the fees and expenses of the arbitration
procedures, including the fees of the arbitrator or arbitrators, will be shared
equally by the involved parties.





(c)                                  Any award
rendered pursuant to such arbitration shall be final, conclusive and binding
upon the parties, and any judgment thereon may be entered and enforced in any
court of competent jurisdiction.





11.4                        Continuation
of Services.  Unless RMSS
initiates an action for Licensee’s failure to make timely and complete payment
of undisputed amounts claimed due to RMSS, RMSS will continue to provide
Maintenance under the Maintenance services agreement, and unless Licensee is
unable to lawfully use the RMSS Software and Modifications thereto, Licensee will
continue to make payments of undisputed amounts to RMSS, in accordance with
this Agreement, notwithstanding a dispute between the parties relating hereto
or otherwise.





12




















12.                               LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.





12.1                        EXCEPT
TO THE EXTENT ARISING FROM GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, BY REASON OF
AN INDEMNITY OBLIGATION HEREUNDER OR BY REASON OF A BREACH OF WARRANTY, EITHER
PARTY’S LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION WHETHER
BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE WHICH ARISES UNDER OR IS RELATED TO THIS
AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE OTHER PARTY’S DIRECT OUT-OF-POCKET DAMAGES,
ACTUALLY INCURRED, WHICH UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL EXCEED, IN THE AGGREGATE,
THE AMOUNT PAID BY LICENSEE TO RMSS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR THE 12-MONTH
PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE THE CLAIM AROSE.





12.2                        IN NO
EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL
OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER OR THE CLAIMS OR DEMANDS MADE
BY ANY THIRD PARTIES, WHETHER OR NOT IT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.





12.3                        Licensee
Software.  RMSS has no
obligation or liability, either express or implied, with respect to the
compatibility of RMSS Software with any other software unless provided or
specified by RMSS including, but not limited to, Licensee software and/or
Licensee-provided third party software.





13.                               INDEMNIFICATION.





13.1                        Property
Damage.  Subject to Section 13
hereof, each party agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other and
its officers, directors, employees, and affiliates (including, where
applicable, the RMSS Subsidiaries and Licensee Subsidiaries), and agents from
any and all liabilities, losses, costs, damages and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from or in connection with the damage, loss
(including theft) or destruction of any real property or tangible personal
property of the indemnified party resulting from the actions or inactions of
any employee, agent or subcontractor of the indemnifying party insofar as such
damage arises out of or is ancillary to fulfilling its obligations under this
Agreement and to the extent such damage is due to any negligence, breach of
statutory duty, omission or default of the indemnifying party, its employees,
agents or subcontractors.





13.2                        Infringement
of RMSS Software.  RMSS agrees to
defend at its own expense, any claim or action brought by any third party
against Licensee and/or against its officers, directors, and employees and
affiliates, for actual or alleged infringement within the United States of any
patent, copyright or other intellectual property right (including, but not
limited to, misappropriation of trade secrets) based upon





13




















the RMSS Software (except to
the extent such infringement claim is caused by Licensee-specified Custom
Modifications to the RMSS Software which could not have been made in a
non-infringing manner) or caused by the combination of RMSS Software with
software or hardware not provided, specified or approved by RMSS, or based upon
the Third Party Software (“Indemnified RMSS Software”). Licensee, at its sole
discretion and cost, may participate in the defense and all negotiations for
its settlement or compromise. RMSS further agrees to indemnify and hold
Licensee, its officers, directors, employees and affiliates harmless from and
against any and all liabilities, losses, costs, damages, and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys’ fees) associated with any such claim or action
incurred by Licensee. RMSS shall conduct and control the defense of any such
claim or action and negotiations for its settlement or compromise, by the
payment of money. RMSS shall give Licensee, and Licensee shall give RMSS, as
appropriate, prompt written notice of any written threat, warning or notice of
any such claim or action against RMSS or Licensee, as appropriate, or any other
user or any supplier of components of the Indemnified RMSS Software, which
could have an adverse impact on Licensee’s use of same, provided RMSS or
Licensee, as appropriate, knows of such claim or action. If in any such suit so
defended, all or any part of the Indemnified RMSS Software (or any component
thereof) is held to constitute an infringement or violation of any other party’s
intellectual property rights and is enjoined, RMSS shall at its sole option
take one or more of the following actions at no additional cost to Licensee: (i) procure
the right to continue the use of the same without material interruption for Licensee;
(ii) replace the same with non-infringing software; (iii) modify said
Indemnified RMSS Software so as to be non-infringing; or (iv) take back
the infringing Indemnified RMSS Software and credit Licensee with an amount
equal to its prepaid
but unused license fees hereunder. The foregoing represents
the sole and exclusive remedy of Licensee for infringement or alleged
infringement.





13.3                        Dispute
Resolution.  The provisions
of Section 13 shall apply with respect to the submission of any claim for
indemnification under this Agreement and the resolution of any disputes
relating to such claim.





14.                               FORCE MAJEURE, TIME OF
PERFORMANCE AND INCREASED COSTS.





14.1                        Force
Majeure.





(a)                                  Neither party
shall be held liable for any delay or failure in performance of its obligations
under this Agreement from any cause which with the observation of reasonable
care, could not have been avoided – which may include, without limitation, acts
of civil or military authority, government regulations, government agencies, epidemics,
war, terrorist acts, riots, insurrections, fires, explosions, earthquakes,
nuclear accidents, floods, power blackouts affecting facilities (the “Affected
Performance”).





14




















(b)                                 Upon the
occurrence of a condition described in Section 14.1(a), the party whose
performance is affected shall give written notice to the other party describing
the Affected Performance, and the parties shall promptly confer, in good faith,
to agree upon equitable, reasonable action to minimize the impact on both
parties of such condition, including, without limitation, implementing disaster
recovery procedures. The parties agree that the party whose performance is
affected shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the delay caused
by the force majeure events and recommence the Affected Performance. If the
delay caused by the force majeure event lasts for more than fifteen (15) Days,
the parties shall negotiate an equitable amendment to this Agreement with
respect to the Affected Performance. If the parties are unable to agree upon an
equitable amendment within ten (10) Days after such fifteen (15)-Day
period has expired, then either party shall be entitled to serve thirty (30)
Days’ notice of termination on the other party with respect to only such
Affected Performance. The remaining portion of the Agreement that does not
involve the Affected Performance shall continue in full force and effect. RMSS
shall be entitled to be paid for that portion of the Affected Performance which
it completed through the termination date.





14.2                        Time of
Performance and Increased Costs.  RMSS’s time of
performance under this Agreement shall be adjusted, if and to the extent
reasonably necessary, in the event and to the extent that (i) Licensee
fails to timely submit material data or materials in the prescribed form or in
accordance with the requirements of this Agreement, (ii) Licensee fails to
perform on a timely basis, the material functions or other responsibilities of
Licensee described in this Agreement, (iii) Licensee or any governmental
agency authorized to regulate or supervise Licensee makes any special request,
which is affirmed by Licensee and/or compulsory on RMSS, which affects RMSS’s
normal performance schedule, or (iv) Licensee has modified the RMSS
Software in a manner affecting RMSS’s burden. In addition, if any of the above
events occur, and such event results in an increased cost to RMSS, RMSS shall
estimate such increased costs in writing in advance and, upon Licensee’s approval,
Licensee shall be required to pay any and all such reasonable, increased costs
to RMSS upon documented expenditure, up to 110% of the estimate.

trigger, would interfere with the normal use of, or access to, any file, datum
or system.





16.4                        Exclusive
Warranties.  EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THIS
AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND EACH
PARTY AGREES THAT ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES THAT ARE NOT EXPRESSLY
PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED AND DISCLAIMED.





17.                               MISCELLANEOUS.





17.1                        Assignment.  Except as set forth herein, neither party may sell, assign, convey, or
transfer the licenses granted hereunder or any of such party’s rights or
interests, or delegate any of its obligations hereunder without the written
consent of the other party, provided, however, that the parties
hereby agree and acknowledge that, upon the consummation of the Merger, Merger
Co and Certegy shall each be permitted assignees of Licensee.  Any assignment hereunder shall be conditioned
upon the understanding that this Agreement shall be binding upon the assigning
party’s successors and assigns. Either party may assign this Agreement to any
Subsidiary that is not a Competitor except that the assigning party shall
remain responsible for all obligations under this Agreement including the
payment of fees. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
Licensee may not assign this Agreement to a Competitor.





17.2                        Severability.  Provided
Licensee retains quiet enjoyment of the RMSS Software including Custom
Modifications and Base Modifications, if any one or more of the provisions
contained herein shall for any reason be held to be unenforceable in any

of this Agreement, but this Agreement shall be construed as if such
unenforceable provision or provisions had never been contained herein, provided
that the removal of such offending term or provision does not materially alter
the burdens or benefits of either of the parties under this Agreement or any Exhibit or
Schedule, in which case the unenforceable portion shall be replaced by one that
reflects the parties original intent as closely as possible while remaining
enforceable..





17.3                        Third Party Beneficiaries.  Except as set forth herein, the provisions of this Agreement are for

17




















17.4                        Governing Law; Forum Selection;
Consent of Jurisdiction.  This Agreement will be governed by and
construed under the laws of the State of Florida, USA, without regard to
principles of conflict of laws. The parties agree that the only circumstance in
which disputes between them, not otherwise excepted from the resolution process
described in Section 11, will not be subject to the provisions of Section 11
is where a party makes a good faith determination that a breach of the terms of
this Agreement by the other party requires prompt and equitable relief. Each of
the parties submits to the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court
sitting in Jacksonville, Florida with respect to such judicial proceedings.
Each of the parties waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance
of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety or to other
security that might be required of any party with respect thereto. Any party
may make service on the other party by sending or delivering a copy of the
process to the party to be served at the address set forth in Section 15
above. Nothing in this Section, however, shall affect the right of any party to
serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law or in equity. Each
party agrees that a final judgment in any action or proceeding so brought shall
be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by law or in equity.





17.5                        Executed in Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be
an original, but such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the
same document.





17.6                        Construction.  The headings and numbering of sections in this Agreement are for
convenience only and shall not be construed to define or limit any of the terms
or affect the scope, meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or the
particular section to which they relate. This Agreement and the provisions
contained herein shall not be construed or interpreted for or against any party
because that party drafted or caused its legal representative to draft any of
its provisions.





17.7                        Entire Agreement.  This Agreement, including the Exhibits and Schedules attached hereto
and the agreements referenced herein constitute the entire agreement between
the parties, and supersedes all prior oral or written agreements,
representations, statements, negotiations, understandings, proposals, marketing
brochures, correspondence and undertakings related thereto.  Without
limiting the foregoing, the parties expressly acknowledge that this Agreement,
together with the Exhibits and Schedules hereto, is intended to amend and
restate the Prior License Agreement in its entirety, and upon the effectiveness
of this Agreement, the Prior License Agreement shall be deemed to have been
superseded and replaced in its entirety by this Agreement.





17.8                        Amendments and Waivers.  This
Agreement may be amended only by written agreement signed by duly authorized
representatives of each party. No waiver of any provisions of this Agreement
and no consent to any default under this





18




















Agreement shall be effective unless the same shall
be in writing and signed by or on behalf of both parties. No course of dealing
or failure of any party to strictly enforce any term, right or condition of
this Agreement shall be construed as a waiver of such term, right or condition.
Waiver by either party of any default by the other party shall not be deemed a
waiver of any other default.





17.9                        Remedies Cumulative.  Unless otherwise provided for under this Agreement, all rights of
termination or cancellation, or other remedies set forth in this Agreement, are
cumulative and are not intended to be exclusive of other remedies to which the
injured party may be entitled by law or equity in case of any breach or
threatened breach by the other party of any provision in this Agreement. Use of
one or more remedies shall not bar use of any other remedy for the purpose of
enforcing any provision of this Agreement.





17.10                 Taxes.  All charges and fees to be paid under this Agreement are exclusive of
any applicable sales, use, service or similar tax which may be assessed
currently or in the future on the RMSS Software or related services provided
under this Agreement. If a sales, use, services or a similar tax is assessed on
the RMSS Software or related services provided to Licensee under this
Agreement, Licensee will pay directly, reimburse or indemnify RMSS for such
taxes as well as any applicable interest and penalties. Licensee shall pay such
taxes in addition to the sums otherwise due under this Agreement. RMSS shall,
to the extent it is aware of taxes, itemize them on a proper VAT, GST or other
invoice submitted pursuant to this Agreement. All property, employment and
income taxes based on the assets, employees and net income, respectively, of
RMSS shall be RMSS’s sole responsibility. The parties will cooperate with each
other in determining the extent to which any tax is due and owing under the
circumstances and shall provide and make available to each other any
withholding certificates, information regarding the location of use of the RMSS
Software or provision of the services or sale and any other exemption
certificates or information reasonably requested by either party.





17.11                 Press Releases. The parties shall consult with each other in
preparing any press release, public announcement, news media response or other
form of release of information concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby that is intended to provide such information to the news
media or the public (a “Press Release”). Neither party shall issue or cause the
publication of any such Press Release without the prior written consent of the
other party; except that nothing herein will prohibit either party from issuing
or causing publication of any such Press Release to the extent that such action
is required by applicable law or the rules of any national stock exchange
applicable to such party or its affiliates, in which case the party wishing to
make such disclosure will, if practicable under the circumstances, notify the
other party of the proposed time of issuance of such Press Release and consult
with and allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such Press Release
in advance of its issuance.

Each of Licensee and Licensor is a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties.”





WHEREAS, Licensor has developed certain software described in
Schedule A, Description of the Software (“Software”);





WHEREAS, Licensee wishes to license the Software (including
the source code to the Software) from Licensor under the terms and conditions set forth below; and





WHEREAS, Licensor wishes to license the Software (including
the source code to the Software) to Licensee under the terms and conditions set forth below.





NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties mutually agree as follows:





1.	GRANT OF LICENSE TO SOFTWARE






License Agreement. At the closing, the Licensor will grant to
the Licensee a regional, exclusive, 3 year, royalty bearing license under Licensor’s intellectual property rights to use,
demonstrate, market, offer for sale, sell, license, and/or otherwise distribute the Software Platform to the following geographic
areas:





(a)Canada


(b)Mexico





In addition, Licensee shall have a right of first negotiation
(the ""ROFN'') to expand the Territory upon notification from Licensor of its intention to negotiate a license for the
Software Platform (or a portion of it) for a new Territory. Licensee must exercise such ROFN (if at all) by written notice to Licensor
within 5 business days after receiving the notice contemplated by the previous sentence. In the event Licensee exercises the ROFN,
the parties shall negotiate in good faith with respect to the terms of such expansion.





Licensor reserves the right to alter the Licensee’s rights
granted under paragraph 1 for non-performance. Non-performance shall be evidenced by failure of Licensee to contractually deliver
business opportunities in the geographic territories outlined above within 180 days of grant of this license. Licensor shall notify
Licensee in writing of non-performance and Licensee shall have an additional 30 days to cure such non-performance. In the event
that Licensee is unable to cure the non-performance, Licensor shall have the right to alter the geographic territory granted to
Licensee under this agreement.





Unless notified in writing, License shall automatically renew
annually after the third anniversary date.





1.	OWNERSHIP OF SOFTWARE




1.	Licensor’s title to the Software, whether in whole or in part, and all copies thereof, and all rights of Licensor therein,

technical data and information in connection therewith will remain in and be property of Licensor until the transfer contemplated
in section 2.1.

1.	The fees and other charges applicable to the Software are set out in Exhibit A. The License Premium shall be paid pursuant
to the Note issued to Licensor in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A1.




1.	Within thirty (30) days of the end of each calendar quarter, Licensee will provide Licensor with a report of the revenue received
by it during the previous quarter together with the payment of the 12.5% royalty thereon calculated in accordance with Exhibit
A. Licensor shall provide Licensee with an invoice for its records immediately upon receipt of the quarterly payment.




1.	With respect to their respective revenue share license fee payments, the Parties agree to pay all license fees, assessments,
sales, use, personal property, excise, and other taxes, and any penalties or interest thereon (""Taxes""), now or
in the future imposed by any appropriate governmental body on such Party with respect to the Software, or any portion thereof,

will bear the expenses of the audit. In the event of any underpayment, Licensee shall promptly remit to the Licensor all amounts
due together with interest calculated at a daily rate equal to 5%.

solely for purposes of or as provided in this Agreement,  any Confidential
Information received by it from the other or derived from Confidential
Information and shall protect the confidentiality of such with the same degree
of care that it exercises with respect to its own information of like import,
but in no event less than reasonable care, for a period of five (5) years from
the date of disclosure.

7.2  Exceptions.  Notwithstanding any provisions herein concerning
non-disclosure and non-use of the Confidential Information, the obligations of
Section 7.1 shall not apply to any portion of the Confidential information
which:

failure to act on the part of the receiving Party becomes generally known in
the computer systems industry;

(b)  is hereafter furnished to the receiving Party by
a third party without obligation to keep such information confidential;

best reasonable efforts to correct reported defects. Phoenix shall not be
responsible for (i) unreported defects, (ii) defects caused by misuse or abuse
of the Software, (iii) defects caused by use of the Software with hardware or
software other than that approved by Phoenix for use with the Software, or for
(iv) Changes made other than by or with the express written authority of
Phoenix. Customer shall be limited to the warranties provided by third-party
licensors or manufacturers with respect to third-party software or equipment
that may be provided by Phoenix.

9.2 DISCLAIMER. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 6.1 ABOVE, PHOENIX SPECIFICALLY
DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

9.3 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT SHALL PHOENIX BE LIABLE FOR ANY
SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE,
OR INABILITY TO USE, THE LICENSED PRODUCTS OR ARISING OUT OF ANY OTHER
CIRCUMSTANCES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING
WITHOUT LIMITATION DAMAGES BASED ON LOSS OF PROFIT, LOSS OR INTERRUPTION OF
DATA OR COMPUTER TIME, ALTERATION OR ERRONEOUS TRANSMISSION OF DATA, EVEN IF
PHOENIX IS ADVISED IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. Phoenix's
total liability to Customer under any provision of this Agreement (other than
indemnification under Section 10) or for any and all claims, losses or damages
relating to the Licensed Products (whether based on tort, contract, or any
other theory), other than claims based upon the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of Phoenix, shall be limited to the amount actually paid by Customer
to Phoenix for the Licensed Products giving rise to the liability. The parties
acknowledge that each of them relied upon the inclusion of this limitation in
consideration of entering into this Agreement.

10   PATENT AND COPYRIGHT INDEMNITY

10.1 Infringement Claims. If a third party claims that the Software infringes
any patent, copyright, trade secret, or similar intellectual property right of
any third party, and such claim would impair Customer's right to use the
Software hereunder, Phoenix shall (as long as Customer is not in default under
this Agreement or any other agreement with Phoenix) defend Customer against
that claim at Phoenix's expense and pay all damages awarded by a court in a
final judgment, provided that Customer (i) promptly notifies Phoenix in writing
of any such claim, (ii) allows Phoenix to control the defense and disposition
of such claim, including any related settlement negotiations, and (iii)
cooperates with Phoenix, at Phoenix's expense, in the defense of such claim.

10.2 Remedies. If such a claim is made or appears possible, Phoenix may, at its
option, either (i) secure for Customer the right to continue to use the
Software, (ii) modify or replace the Software so it is non-infringing, or (iii)
refund a pro-rata portion of the license fees paid for the infringing material
based on a five year straight line useful period. Phoenix has no obligation
hereunder for any claim based on a modified version of the Software which has
not been prepared solely by Phoenix, or for any combination, operation or use
of the Software with any hardware or software not approved in writing by
Phoenix. Phoenix also shall have no obligation hereunder for any claim based on
theories of law that are not substantially equivalent to laws, treaties and
conventions applicable to U.S. patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and similar
intellectual property rights. THIS SECTION 10 STATES PHOENIX'S ENTIRE
OBLIGATION TO CUSTOMER WITH RESPECT TO MATTERS OF TITLE OR ANY CLAIM OF
INFRINGEMENT THEREOF.

confidentiality of the Confidential Information of the other. Each Party shall
not permit or authorize access to, or disclosure of, the Confidential
Information of the other to any person or entity other than employees or
advisors who have a ""need to know"" such information in order to enable the
receiving party to exercise its rights or perform its obligations under this
Agreement. Neither party shall disclose or supply the Confidential Information
of the other to any non-employee third party without the prior written approval
of the other party, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, provided
the requesting party can demonstrate a need for such disclosure in order to
comply with its obligations hereunder. Either party may disclose portions of
the Confidential Information of the other to governmental regulatory
authorities if such disclosure is required by applicable laws, provided the
party required to make such disclosure notifies the other party of the
applicable legal requirements before such disclosure occurs and assists the
other party to obtain such protection as may be available to preserve the
confidentiality of such information.

11.2 Disposal. Prior to disposal of any media or materials that contain any
part of the Software, Documentation or other Confidential Information of
Phoenix, Customer shall obliterate or otherwise destroy all code, instructions,
commentary, or further evidence of Confidential Information, for example, by
erasing, incinerating, or shredding such materials.

12   ARBITRATION

In the event a claim, controversy or dispute between


6
<PAGE>   7
CONFIDENTIAL


Phoenix and Customer arises out of or in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions and business contemplated hereby, including the validity,
construction or enforcement thereof, either party may demand that such matter
be submitted to final and binding arbitration. The situs of all arbitration
proceedings shall be Atlanta, Georgia, unless Phoenix and Customer agree in
writing to another situs. All arbitration proceedings and records shall be in
English. Issuance of an arbitration demand shall suspend the effect of any
default entailed by such claim, controversy or dispute and any judicial or
administrative proceedings instituted in connection therewith, for the duration
of the arbitration proceedings. Arbitration shall be governed by the commercial
rules of the International Chamber of Commerce (the ""ICC""). Arbitration shall
be conducted by one arbitrator who shall be chosen by the ICC within 5 days of
receipt of the arbitration demand. The arbitrator or arbitrators shall
determine whether a default has occurred, and shall deliver its or their
decision within 45 days of the date of receipt of the arbitration demand,
specifying such remedy (including money damages) as shall (a) fully implement
the intent and purposes of this Agreement and (b) indemnify and hold harmless
the non-breaching party from all losses, costs and expenses (including costs of
arbitration and reasonable attorneys' fees) resulting from the default.
Termination or limitation of Phoenix's rights in the Software, the
Documentation, or any associated intellectual property rights may not be
awarded under any circumstances. The right to demand arbitration and to receive
damages and obtain other available remedies as provided hereunder shall be the
exclusive remedy in the event an arbitration demand is made, except that
Phoenix shall be entitled to obtain equitable relief, such as injunctive
relief, from any court of competent jurisdiction in order to protect its rights
in the Software, the Documentation, or any associated intellectual property
rights while such proceeding is pending or in support of any award made
pursuant to such arbitration. Phoenix and Customer hereby consent to the
enforcement in the courts of each country in the Territory and the United
States of any arbitral judgment or award rendered pursuant to this Section.

13   COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS

13.1 Compliance with Laws. Customer shall, at its own expense, comply with all
laws relating to the licensing and use of the Licensed Products, and shall
procure all licenses and pay all fees and other charges required thereby.

13.2 Export Restrictions. Customer shall not ship or export the Licensed
Products outside of the Territory without the express written consent of
Phoenix.

13.3 Corrupt Practices. Neither Customer nor any of its directors, officers,
employees, or agents will make, offer to make, or accept any payment or gift
directly or indirectly to any employee, officer, or representative of any
governmental entity or instrumentality or to any foreign political party, any
official of a foreign political party, or candidate, where such payment would
constitute a bribe, kickback, or illegal payment under U.S. or applicable
foreign laws.

14   GENERAL

14.1 Notice. Notices shall be deemed given upon receipt if transmitted by fax,
registered mail or FedEx, DHL, or other international courier service if
properly addressed as first set forth above, or to such other address as may be
requested by written notice in compliance with this Section.

14.2 Assignment. Customer may not assign, transfer, or delegate its rights or
obligations hereunder without Phoenix's prior written consent. Subject to the
foregoing, this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the
parties hereto and their permitted successors and assigns. For purposes of this
Section, the acquisition of more than 50% of the voting stock of Customer, the
acquisition of all or substantially all the business and assets of Customer, or
the merger of Customer with or into another entity shall constitute an
unauthorized assignment, unless all other provisions of this Agreement are duly
honored, the surviving entity signs a new license agreement with Phoenix
containing terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to Phoenix, and the
surviving entity pays additional license fees for use of the Licensed Products
for the new or different number of Remote and Additional Branches and/or

RESPONSE AND RESOLUTION GUIDELINES

PROBLEM SEVERITY LEVELS

Every call is assigned a severity level during its setup within the call log.
This severity level controls both the manner and speed with which the Customer
Support specialist responds back to the caller, as well as the timetable within
which the support group works to resolve the problem. Standard severity levels
are as follows:

Critical   Highest priority classification. Assigned to problems that
prevent the bank from conducting normal business, typically
problems involving core processing failures, recurring
application crashes, and serious calculative errors.

High       Second highest priority classification. Assigned to problems
that have a serious impact on the bank's operations, but do not
prevent the bank from conducting business. Examples of
high-priority problems include nightly processing errors that
cause the bank to go out of balance, reports with incorrect
information, and inaccurate display screen calculations.

Medium     Third highest priority classification. Assigned to problems that
inconvenience the bank but do necessarily represent calculative
errors or other software failures. Typical medium-priority
problems include print routines that take longer than desired,
account setup routines that require redundant data entry, and
window options that do not properly reflect bank-defined default
values.

Low        Lowest priority classification. Assigned to problems that are
primarily cosmetic in nature (typographical errors, alignment
problems, etc.). Low-priority problems detract from the system's
elegance and polish, but not from its core functionality.

RESPONSE GUIDELINES

Following are the target response times for each level of problem severity:

Critical   A return call must be made within 45 minutes.

High       A return call must be made to the bank within 3 hours, but never
later than the end of that business day, unless calls come in
within 1 hour of the end of the business day, in which case a
return call must be made within the first 2 hours of the next
business day.

Medium     A return call must be made to the bank during the same business
day, or if the call comes within 3 hours of the end of the
business day, a return call must be made by the end of the next
business day.

Low        A return call must be made by the end of the next business day.



15
<PAGE>   16
CONFIDENTIAL


RESOLUTION GUIDELINES

Following are the target resolution timeframes for each classification. Given
the uncertain nature of troubleshooting technical software problems, however,
Phoenix will use best efforts to meet these guidelines, but cannot guarantee
such time frames.

Critical   For calls logged either during or after normal support hours,
the problem should be resolved within 5 hours. Phoenix shall
involve such resources as necessary to remedy critical errors as
soon as possible, including escalating the problem to the Senior
Vice President in charge of Client Services within 1 hour.

High       For calls logged either during or after normal support hours,
the problem should be resolved within 24 hours.

Medium     Based on consultation with the bank, the problem should be
resolved either during the next scheduled software release
(preferred) or, at the bank's explicit request, within 5
business days.

Low        The problem should be resolved according to a mutually agreed
schedule.

systems which incorporate the Software into an overall business or information
systems process.  Customer shall pay Ambix its then-current fees for any
modification.  Customer may not modify or cause to be modified the Software

Agreement shall belong to Ambix.  Any modified version of the Software, or any
system which incorporates the Software in modified form, just as in its original
form as defined under this Agreement, shall be for Customer's own use as
specified under this Agreement in Schedules II and III.  The modified version or
newly merged version of the Software shall remain subject to all of the terms
and conditions of this Agreement.  In addition to the notices required by
Section 10 of Schedule I (above), Customer shall include the following notice in
both machine readable form and on all Documentation for the modified version of
the Software or merged system comprising any part or all of the Software:

""This program or system includes information, concepts, ideas, know-
how, and techniques which are confidential and constitute proprietary
information and trade secrets of Ambix Systems Corp. of Rochester, New
York and are protected by copyright or pending copyright;

@ 1995 Ambix Systems Corp.""

In the event this Agreement is terminated, the Software shall be completely
removed from any system containing the software and from any information systems
process using the Software, whether as a modified program or modified system
integrating Ambix programs in modified or unmodified form. and treated as if
permission to modify had never been granted and all copies of all Documentation
shall be returned to Ambix.

12.0  WARRANTY.  Ambix warrants that it is the rightful owner of the Software
and that it has the right to license the Software to Customer.  After completion
of the Acceptance test outlined in Section 13, and while Customer continues to
license the Software, Ambix warrants that the Software will be free of
programming errors which significantly affect the performance of the Software
from the standards and specifications contained in Schedule II.  Further, upon
Customer signing a Software Support Agreement, and as part of this Support
Agreement and at no additional charge to Customer, Ambix will immediately
correct any programming errors reported to Ambix.  Ambix's only obligation under
this Warranty shall be to amend, revise, modify, or replace the Software at
Ambix's then-current rates for programming and support services.  The warranty
contained in this Section 12 shall apply to unmodified versions of the Software,
and Ambix makes no warranty as to any version of the Software modified by anyone
other than Ambix.  Amendment, revision, modification, or replacement of the
Software will be performed at Customer's request at Ambix's then-current rates
for such services, subject to availability of Ambix personnel.  AMBIX MAKES NO
OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, AS TO
<PAGE>

ANY MATTER WHATSOEVER, AND DISCLAIMS ALL SUCH WARRANTIES INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

13.0  ACCEPTANCE.  Customer will use the software during the thirty (30)
business days immediately following installation (the ""Acceptance Period"") of
the Software to determine whether or not it conforms to the functional and
performance specifications attached as Schedule II (the ""Specifications"").  Any
failures of the Software to conform to the Specifications discovered by
Customer, during the Acceptance Period, will be reported promptly to Ambix.
Ambix will immediately make any corrections necessary to make the Software
conform with the Specifications.  Upon satisfactory completion of the Acceptance
Testing process, Customer shall provide Ambix with written notification of
acceptance and shall pay to Ambix the final $44,000 monthly installment payment.

14.0  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  Ambix's liability under this Agreement for
damages, regardless of the form of action, shall be limited to money damages
which shall not exceed the total amount paid by Customer for the License granted
hereunder.  This shall be Customer's exclusive remedy.  In no event shall either
party be liable for any loss of product, loss of profit, loss of use or any
other actual, special, incidental, consequential damages, or other damages of
any kind whether foreseeable or unforeseeable, resulting from or arising out of
the license or use of the Software, even if such party shall have been advised
of possibility of such loss or damages.

15.0  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT.  If notified promptly in writing of
any action (and all prior claims relating to such action) brought against
Customer, based on a claim that the Customer's use of the Software infringes a
United States patent, copyright, trademark or a trade secret (hereafter
collectively ""intellectual property rights"") of a third party, Ambix will defend
such action at its expense and pay the costs and damages awarded in any such
action.  Ambix will have the sole control of the defense of any such action and
all negotiations for its settlement or compromise.  At any time during the
course of any litigation arising out of a claim of infringement of an
intellectual property right, or if, in Ambix's opinion, the intellectual
property or any part thereof is likely to become the subject of a claim of
infringement, Ambix will, at its sole option and at its expense, either procure
for Customer the right to continue using the Software, replace or modify the
same with a compatible, functionally equivalent, non-infringing product, or
grant Customer a full refund of the License Fees specified in Schedule V, and
accept its return.  The depreciation will be an equal amount per year over the
lifetime of the Software as established by Ambix.  Ambix will not have any
liability to Customer under any provision of this paragraph if the infringement,
or claim thereof, is based upon (a) the use of the Software in combination with
other software not furnished by Ambix; or (b) the use of other than the latest
supportable version of the Software made available to Customer.

Customer will hold Ambix harmless from and against any expense, cost,
damage, judgment, or loss or other liability of any kind, for infringement of
any intellectual property right which result from Ambix's compliance with
Customer's designs, specifications, instructions or from the use of the Software
as altered or modified by anyone other than Ambix.
<PAGE>

Customer is obligated hereby to promptly notify Ambix of any instance
of infringement or attempted infringement upon the intellectual property rights
of Ambix which comes to Customer's attention.

The foregoing states the entire liability of Ambix with respect to
infringement of an intellectual property right by the Software or any part
thereof or by its operation.

16.0  TERMINATION OF LICENSE.  The license granted to Customer hereunder may be
terminated by Ambix upon not less than two months (2 months) notice if Customer
fails to perform any of its material obligations or duties under this Agreement,
unless within such period Customer cures such failure.  If however, Customer
cannot in good faith cure such failure within the two month period, then
Customer must commence cure immediately and continue to diligently pursue such
cure of any such failure(s).  Upon termination of this Agreement, Customer shall
immediately cease using the Software and, at the option of Ambix, Customer shall
destroy or return to Ambix all tangible forms of the Software and the
Documentation and Customer shall erase the Software from all storage media in
which it has been installed or copied.  Within (30) thirty days after
termination of this Agreement, Customer shall certify to Ambix in writing that
it has destroyed or delivered to Ambix all tangible forms of the Software and
that it has erased the Software from all storage media.

17.0  EXPORT REGULATIONS.  Customer agrees, regardless of permissions granted by
Ambix, not to export, either directly or indirectly, any Ambix Software or
systems incorporating such Software without first obtaining any required license
to export or re-export from the United States Government or appropriate foreign
government as may be required and to comply with all United States and
international export regulations as applicable.

18.0  MISCELLANEOUS.

18.A  Binding Effect.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the parties hereto, their personal representatives, and
permitted successors and assigns.

18.B  No Assignment.  Customer may not assign nor sublicense this
Agreement, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of Ambix,
which may be withheld in Ambix's sole discretion.  Customer may without the

We grant, and you accept, a perpetual, non-exclusive and non-transferable
license for you and your affiliates to use the Software listed above, subject to
all the terms of this License.

While such license does not include the right to transfer or sublicense (other
than to your affiliates), we acknowledge and agree that you may utilize the
Software in support of store layout design, collation and dissemination of
retail sales intelligence, design and manufacture of display systems and other
product and services businesses, and that such utilization will include, among
other matters, making the results that are produced from using the Software
available to retailers and brand-owners in order to measure the efficacy of the
products and services provided by or through you or your affiliates to any such
retailer and brand-owner. The Total Amount Due is payable upon delivery of the
Software and execution of a software escrow agreement for your benefit with a
third party escrow agent reasonably satisfactory to you (the ""Effective Date"").

Maintenance service commences after expiration of the limited warranty service
period of ninety (90) days. The cost for maintenance for the first nine (9)
months of maintenance following the limited warranty period is included in the
Total License Fee Amount. Maintenance of the Software shall continue thereafter
annually unless and until terminated by you on not less than thirty (30) days
prior written notice to us. The cost of maintenance is calculated as 18% of the
then current license fee for the applications included in this agreement for the
first year following the initial nine (9) month period payable at the beginning
of the maintenance period for which payment is made. For all subsequent years
for which maintenance services may be contracted the maintenance fee may be
increased annually to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index. If you
elect to cancel and later wish to resume maintenance services, you will, as a
condition of maintenance resumption, pay us all maintenance fees that would have
been due from the date of cancellation to the date of resumption, as if you had
not cancelled maintenance services. With respect to maintenance services, you
will reimburse us for all charges that we incur in computer-to-computer
communications and for travel, accommodations and other reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses for such services performed outside of Park City, Utah with your
consent, which may not be unreasonably withheld. Any additional services or
other offerings from Park City Group for the benefit of Customer will be covered
under separate agreement(s).

The Software is licensed, not sold.

5. LIMITED WARRANTY

5.1 What Our Limited Warranty Covers. We warrant that the Software
delivered to you will conform in all material respects to specifications
contained in the Documentation, to the description thereof set forth in Exhibit
1 hereto, to the version of the Software previously delivered to you and to the
most recent version of the Software on the date of delivery, will be free of
computer viruses and will be free from ""material"" defects, for a period of
ninety (90) days after delivery. During the warranty period, and thereafter so
long as you subscribe and pay for our maintenance services, we will (a) provide
you with hot line telephone support from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. MST, on regular
business days, excluding our holidays; (b) provide you with corrections, updates
and other modifications that we develop and make available to our maintenance
customers without additional charge; and (c) provide, as soon as is reasonably
practicable, an avoidance procedure for or correction to any breach of the
foregoing warranty. For such purpose, a defect is ""material"" if it causes
execution of the Software to terminate abnormally, produces misleading or
incorrect results, does not perform a function described in the Documentation,
or impairs data integrity. If we are unable after reasonable efforts to provide
an avoidance procedure or correction curing such breach, you may (i) during the
limited warranty period, terminate your license of the defective Software module
or, (ii) during any maintenance period, terminate your license and our
maintenance services for the defective Software module. EXCEPT FOR ANY REMEDIES
THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE TO YOU UNDER THE SOFTWARE ESCROW AGREEMENT, THE PROVISIONS
OF THIS SECTION 5.1 SET FORTH OUR ENTIRE LIABILITY AND YOUR SOLE REMEDIES WITH
RESPECT TO OUR WARRANTY AND MAINTENANCE SERVICES. Services are available only
for the most current and the immediately preceding version or edition of the
Software. You will provide us with a personal computer or workstation identical
to and configured exactly like the personal computers or workstations on which
you have installed the Software (we will return the computer or workstation when
our maintenance services end). Either of us may terminate maintenance services
at the end of the current period on 30 days prior notice.

5.2 What Our Limited Warranty Does Not Cover. We do not warrant
uninterrupted or error-free operation, compatibility with hardware or software
not specified in the documentation, or anything concerning Third Party Software.
Our warranty will terminate (a) if the Software is not installed, operated and
maintained in accordance with instructions and specifications contained in the
Documentation or is modified in a manner not authorized by us, (b) if
corrections, updates and modifications supplied by us are not implemented or (c)
if you do not reasonably cooperate with us so that we can fulfill our
responsibilities hereunder.

5.3 NO OTHER WARRANTIES. THE ABOVE WARRANTY IS MADE IN LIEU OF, AND WE
DISCLAIM, ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED
TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

6. PATENTS AND COPYRIGHTS

We will defend you against claims that the Software or any portion
thereof infringes a U.S. patent or copyright, and pay (a) all costs, damages and
attorney's fees finally awarded against you as a result of such claim, and (b)
any settlement of such claim, provided that you notify us promptly in writing of
such claim, give us complete authority and control of, and fully cooperate with
us in, the defense and settlement of such claim. If any such claim occurs, or in
our sole opinion is likely to occur, we will in our sole discretion and at our
own expense (i) procure for you the right to continue use of the infringing
Software, (ii) modify or replace the Software so that it becomes non-infringing,
without impairing its functionality, or (iii) direct you to cease using the
infringing Software. If we direct you to cease use, or if we cannot provide a

<PAGE>

right to continue use, or a replacement or modification, of the infringing
Software, we will refund your license fee for the infringing Software or
infringing portion thereof, less a charge for use based on straight-line
amortization of such fee over five (5) years. We have no liability or obligation
for claims based on (A) modifications not authorized or supplied by us, (B) the
combination of the Software with other software or hardware not specified in the
Documentation, (C) infringement by Third Party Software alone, rather than in
combination with the Software, (D) claims that could have been avoided by timely
implementation of corrections, updates and modifications provided by us and (E)
any settlement made by you without our consent. THIS SECTION 6 STATES OUR ENTIRE
OBLIGATION FOR INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS.

7. MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FROM ALL
CAUSES OF ACTION OF ANY KIND RELATED TO THIS LICENSE, INCLUDING TORT, CONTRACT,
NEGLIGENCE AND STRICT LIABILITY, EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY YOU TO US.

8. EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES. REGARDLESS WHETHER ANY REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN
FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OR OTHERWISE, IN NO EVENT WILL WE BE LIABLE FOR
ANY LOST PROFITS OR DATA, OR ANY FORM OF SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT,
CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, EVEN IF WE KNEW OR HAD REASON TO
KNOW IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

9. NO RIGHT OF TERMINATION; REMEDIES

This License is non-terminable, without prejudice to the right of each
party to sue the other for breach of contract and recover damages.

10. GENERAL

10.1 Attorney's Fees. The prevailing party in any legal action
concerning this License is entitled to recover its reasonable attorney's fees
and costs following a final judgment.

any right, privilege, remedy or option under this License.

of a contractual agreement between the parties and that we will not disclose the
specific terms and conditions of the agreement.

10.5 Export. The Software is subject to restrictions and controls
imposed under U.S. export laws. You certify that neither the Software nor any
direct product thereof is being or will be exported or re-exported, directly or
indirectly, to any country for which a validated license is required under such
laws without first obtaining such a validated license.

10.6 Excusable Delays. We are not liable for delays in or failure of
performance due to causes beyond our reasonable control.

10.7 Governing Law. This License is governed by the laws of Utah,
excluding laws pertaining to choice of law. Any provision found to be
unenforceable or invalid will be severable and will not affect the
enforceability or validity of the other provisions to the maximum extent

2.7. Title, Notices, Acceptance, Etc.

(a)  Licensee  acknowledges  that  GSE owns the  patent,  copyright,  trade
secret and other  proprietary  rights in the Software and  Promotional
Materials  and all  copies of the  Software.  GSE grants  Licensee  no
licenses or other rights with respect thereto,  including any licenses
by  implication  or  estoppel,  except as  expressly  granted  by this
Agreement. Licensee shall not develop Derivatives or use, demonstrate,
market,  copy,  sublicense,  distribute  or disclose  the  Software or
Derivatives except as specifically authorized herein.

(b)  GSE acknowledges that Licensee will own any patent,  copyright,  trade
secret and other  proprietary  rights arising from the  development of
Permitted Derivatives by and for Licensee,  subject to GSE's rights in
the  Software.  Subject  to all  the  terms  and  conditions  of  this
Agreement,  Licensee hereby grants to GSE, and GSE hereby accepts from
Licensee,   a  perpetual,   worldwide,   nontransferable   (except  in
accordance  with  Article  11),  nonexclusive  license  under  all  of
Licensee's  patent,  copyright,  trade  secret  and other  proprietary
rights in Derivatives to use, reproduce,  adapt,  distribute,  perform
and display any software or other item and to  authorize  others to do
the same.

(c)  Licensee hereby acknowledges GSE's delivery and Licensee's  acceptance
of the Software by virtue of the activities  contemplated by the Asset
Purchase Agreement.

(d)  For a period of one (1) year, commencing on the Closing Date, Licensee
may use in its  marketing of the Software  and  Permitted  Derivatives
truthful  statements  identifying  the Software as a former product of
GSE;  provided  that  Licensee  shall  use  GSE's  name  only  in such
statements  and  not  use  GSE's  name  or any  trademark  of GSE as a
trademark  (except for trademarks  transferred to Licensee pursuant to
the Asset  Purchase  Agreement).  Thereafter,  except as  provided  in
Section  2.5.a.  with  respect to  copyright  and  proprietary  rights
notices,  Licensee shall not identify GSE in its marketing of Software
and Derivatives.  At no time shall Licensee provide to any third party
any false or  misleading  description  of fact, or false or misleading
representation  of fact,  or  engage in any  other  activity  which is
likely to suggest  that GSE is the  then-current  source of supply for
the Software or Permitted Derivatives or otherwise cause confusion, or
cause mistake,  or to deceive as to the  affiliation,  connection,  or
association  of  GSE  with  Licensee,  the  Software,  Derivatives  or
Promotional Material.

3. Right Of First Refusal

3.1. GSE shall not sell,  transfer,  assign or otherwise dispose of the SimSuite
Pipeline  Software without first offering to sell the SimSuite Pipeline Software
to Licensee in accordance  with this Article.  If GSE receives a bona fide offer
(an  ""Offer"")  from a third  party not  related to or  affiliated  with GSE,  to
purchase GSE's rights in the SimSuite Pipeline Software,  and GSE is prepared to
accept the Offer,  GSE shall  first make an offer in writing to Licensee to sell
the SimSuite  Pipeline Software to Buyer on the same terms and conditions as the
Offer.  Notwithstanding the above, GSE may sell, transfer or assign the SimSuite
Pipeline  Software  to an  affiliate  or parent  company  without  regard to the
restrictions  in this Article,  provided  that the  affiliate or parent  company
agrees to be bound by this Agreement.

3.2. GSE's offer to Licensee shall be open for acceptance by Licensee for thirty
(30) days after its receipt.  If no acceptance is received from Licensee  within
the  thirty  (30) day  period,  the  offer to sell  shall be deemed to have been
refused by Licensee  and GSE may proceed  with  selling  the  SimSuite  Pipeline
Software  at a price not less than the  price,  and on terms not more  favorable
than the terms at which the SimSuite Pipeline Software was offered to Licensee.

3.3. If no sale of the  SimSuite  Pipeline  Software is  completed by GSE within
ninety  (90) days  following  the date of  rejection  (or deemed  rejection)  by
Licensee of GSEs offer,  GSE shall be required,  before selling,  transferring,'
assigning or otherwise  disposing of the SimSuite  Pipeline  Software,  to again
offer the SimSuite Pipeline Software to Licensee in the manner set out above.

3.4. The  provisions of this Article shall not apply to commercial  arrangements
within the  ordinary  course of GSE's  business  outside  the  markets for which
Licensee's rights are exclusive under this Agreement.

4. Intentionally Deleted

5. Confidentiality

5.1. For the purpose of this Article, the term ""Confidential  Information"" means
the Software, Derivatives to the extent they incorporate Software or information
contained in Software,  and any other  material or  information  relating to the
Software that GSE treats as confidential  and provides to Licensee in connection
with this Agreement;  provided that ""Confidential  Information"" does not include
any material or  information  that Licensee can  demonstrate:  (i) is or becomes
publicly  known  through no fault of Licensee,  (ii) is  rightfully  obtained by
Licensee from a third party not obligated to preserve its confidentiality. (iii)
by clear and  convincing  documentation,  was already known to Licensee prior to
the  delivery of any Software  licensed  pursuant to this  Agreement  through no
infringement  of any  proprietary  right of GSE or  breach of an  obligation  of
confidentiality owed to GSE, and (iv) by clear and convincing documentation, has
been independently developed by Licensee without access to the Software licensed
pursuant to this Agreement.

5.2. Licensee shall not use Confidential  Information for any purpose other than
in  accordance   with  this  Agreement  and  shall  not  disclose   Confidential
Information  to any person  other than its  employees  who have signed a written
nondisclosure  agreement  comparable in scope to this Article and have a need to
know such Confidential Information.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensee may
disclose  Confidential  Information  to the extent  required by a court or other
governmental  authority,  provided that (i) Licensee gives GSE reasonable notice
of the disclosure,  (ii) Licensee uses reasonable  efforts to resist  disclosing
the Confidential Information, (iii) Licensee cooperates with GSE on a request to
obtain a protective order or otherwise limit the disclosure, and (iv) as soon as
reasonably possible, Licensee provides a letter from its counsel confirming that
the Confidential Information is, in fact, required to be disclosed.

5.3.  Licensee  shall guard  against  unauthorized  access to or  disclosure  of
Confidential  Information by  commercially  reasonable  procedures,  which in no
event  shall be less  protective  than the  procedures  employed  by Licensee to
protect its own similar  information.  Without  limiting the  generality  of the
foregoing, Licensee shall (i) store or use the source code for the Software only
on computers separated from public networks and from private networks that could
allow access to employees who do not have a need to know such source code;  (ii)
maintain  logs of the  location  of all  copies of such  source  code and of the
employees  having access  thereto;  and (iii) provide copies of such logs to GSE
upon GSE's request.

5.4.  The parties  acknowledge  that  Licensee's  breach of this Article 5 would
cause GSE  irreparable  injury for which it would not have an adequate remedy at
law.  In the event of a breach,  the  non-breaching  party  shall be entitled to
injunctive  relief in  addition  to any other  remedies it may have at law or in
equity.

6. Infringement Warranty and Indemnity

6.1 GSE represents and warrants that it has the right to license the Software to
Licensee.  GSE shall  indemnify,  defend,  and hold  harmless  Licensee  and its
respective  successors  and  assigns  and the  directors,  officers,  employees,
managing partners and agents of each (collectively,  the ""Licensee Group""),  at,
and at any time after,  the Closing Date,  from and against any and all demands,
claims, actions, or causes of action, assessments, losses, damages, liabilities,
costs, and expenses,  including  reasonable fees and expenses of counsel,  other
expenses of  investigation,  handling,  and litigation,  and settlement  amounts
(collectively,  a ""Loss"" or ""Losses""),  asserted against,  resulting to, imposed
upon, or incurred by the Licensee Group,  directly or indirectly,  by reason of,
resulting  from,  or arising in  connection  with any use of the Software by the
Licensee  or its  customers  in the same manner used by GSE prior to the Closing
Date that  infringes the  intellectual  property  rights of any person under the
laws of the United States or Canada or infringes:

(1)  a patent or copyright  under the laws of the countries  listed in
Exhibit B; or

(2)  a trade secret  under the laws of any  country,  if the same acts
also would constitute a  misappropriation  of trade secrets under
the laws of the United States.


If any  portion  of the  Software  is  held to  constitute  an  infringement  or
misappropriation  and its use is  enjoined  (or if GSE  believes  that  any such
portion may be so held and enjoined), GSE may at its own expense:

(a)  procure for Licensee the right to continue  using such portion of
the Software;

(b)  replace such portion of the Software  with a  non-infringing  and
non-misappropriating   functional   equivalent   satisfactory  to
Licensee; or

(c)  modify  such  portion of the  Software in a way  satisfactory  to
Licensee    so    that    it    becomes     non-infringing    and
non-misappropriating.

6.2 Licensee shall indemnify,  defend,  and hold harmless GSE and its successors
and  assigns  and  the  directors,   officers,  employees,  and  agents  of  GSE
(collectively,  the ""GSE Group""),  at, and at any time after,  the Closing Date,
from and against any and all Losses  asserted  against,  resulting  to,  imposed
upon,  or  incurred  by the GSE Group,  directly  or  indirectly,  by reason of,
resulting  from, or arising in connection with Licensee's use or distribution of
the Software or  Derivatives,  except to the extent that such Losses are subject
to GSE's indemnification obligations under the provisions of Section 6.1 of this
Agreement or Article 11.1 of the Asset Purchase Agreement.

6.3 The party  entitled to  indemnification  hereunder  (the  ""Claimant"")  shall
promptly  deliver to the party liable for such  indemnification  hereunder  (the
""Obligor"")  notice in writing (the ""Required  Notice"") of any claim for recovery
under Section 6.1 or Section 6.2,  specifying in reasonable detail the nature of
the Loss,  and,  if known,  the amount,  or an  estimate  of the amount,  of the
liability  arising  therefrom (the  ""Claim"").  The Claimant shall provide to the
Obligor as promptly as  practicable  thereafter  information  and  documentation
reasonably  requested  by the Obligor to support and verify the claim  asserted,
provided  that, in so doing,  it may restrict or condition any disclosure in the
interest of preserving privileges of importance in any foreseeable litigation.

6.4 The  parties  agree  that any  breach of the  foregoing  representation  and
warranty in this Article 6 or claim to  indemnification  under this Article 6 is
subject to the  provisions of Articles  11.3,  11.4,  11.5 and 11.6 of the Asset
Purchase Agreement.

7. Warranties

EXCEPT AS  PROVIDED IN SECTION  6.1,  SOFTWARE  AND  PROMOTIONAL  MATERIALS  ARE

IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

8. Limitation of Liability

GSE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE HEREUNDER FOR INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THEIR POSSIBILITY.

9. Termination

If Licensee fails to comply with any material  provision of this Agreement,  GSE
may give  Licensee  written  notice of breach  and,  unless such breach is fully
cured within  thirty (30) days after the receipt of notice by Licensee,  GSE may
thereupon,  at its option,  terminate this Agreement upon further written notice
to Licensee.

10. Notices

Any notice,  request,  instruction,  other communication or other document to be
given  hereunder  by any party hereto to the other party shall be in writing and

1st Amendment to Jabber OEM Software License Agree



EXHIBIT 10.17
FIRST AMENDMENT
TO
JABBER OEM SOFTWARE
LICENSE AGREEMENT
This FIRST AMENDMENT TO JABBER OEM SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT (this “Amendment”) by and between Jabber, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (“Jabber”), and France Telecom, a French corporation (“Distributor”), is dated as of October 17, 2002.
RECITALS
WHEREAS, Jabber and Distributor are parties to that certain Jabber OEM Software License Agreement dated as of October 1, 2001 (“Agreement”); and
WHEREAS, the parties desire, pursuant to Section 36 of the Agreement, to amend certain provisions of the Agreement.
AGREEMENT
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, agreements and understandings herein contained, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
1.       Third Party Resellers. Each appearance in the Agreement of the term “Third Party Reseller” or “Third Party Resellers” is hereby replaced with the term “Affiliate” or
“Affiliates,” respectively.
2.       Amendment to Section 3(iv).
Section 3(iv) of the Agreement is amended and restated in its entirety as follows:

(iv) market, publicly perform, publicly display, sublicense and distribute the Software worldwide solely to Affiliates pursuant to Distribution Agreements (as defined below) entered into between Distributor and one or
more Affiliates. The Affiliates shall have the right to sublicense the Software to any Customer (as defined below) solely for purposes of providing the Product to such Customer, provided that (i) the Software is hosted by the Affiliate on servers
maintained and accessed exclusively by the Affiliate or its designee, and the Customer receives only remote access to the Software; (ii) the Customer is permitted to use the Software solely for its own internal business purposes (without the right
of further sublicense or distribution); and (iii) the provision of the Software to Customers and the Product is branded under the Affiliate’s trade name or other proprietary indicia of commercial origin. Subject to the foregoing, Affiliates
shall have the right to distribute the Software and the Product to Customers through authorized agents, provided that no Affiliate shall be relieved of any of its contractual or other











obligations to Distributor and/or Jabber or liability therefore under this Agreement or the applicable Distribution Agreement by virtue of the appointment of such agents.


3.       Amendment to Section 3(v). The first
sentence of Section 3(v) of the Agreement is deleted in its entirety and the following sentence is added at the end of the Section:
“A party will be assumed to control another party if it owns 20% or more
of the party’s outstanding voting securities.”
4.       Amendment to Section
11. Section 11 of the Agreement is deleted and amended and restated in its entirety as follows:
11.      Enhancements and Upgrades;
Distributor-Developed Software. For Jabber to remain competitive, Jabber believes it should average at least two Major Upgrades to the Software during each of the next several years. In order to improve Jabber’s product
development capabilities, Jabber desires to work closely with Distributor to develop upgrades to the Software, particularly upgrades designed to address the needs of current and potential Mobile and ISP and Public customers (as defined in Exhibit
D). Jabber and Distributor have been working together to assist the other in its respective product development efforts. In the event that Distributor elects to pursue Part II, the parties will formalize their current working relationship in an
effort to further accelerate their respective product development efforts. It is understood that by this Agreement, Distributor has not committed to make any of its intellectual property available to Jabber nor has Jabber committed to make any
particular improvement to or number of Major Upgrades to the Software. Rather, this joint effort is intended to assist each party in its efforts to develop industry-leading products and services that it can market to its current and future
customers.

(i)  Jabber Software Release Schedules. During the Time-Based, Fixed Fee license period (as described in Exhibit D hereto) and the term of any period during which
Distributor is licensing any New Releases (as defined in Exhibit D hereto), Distributor agrees to assist Jabber to accomplish its goal of releasing at least two Major Upgrades per year. A “Major Upgrade” shall mean any upgrade of the
Software that introduces significant new functionalities, as determined by Jabber in its reasonable discretion.



(ii)  Technical Cooperation. As part of the planning process associated with the development of Major Upgrades, Jabber and Distributor agree to cooperate closely in
good faith and Jabber agrees to use its commercially reasonable best efforts to inform Distributor of the nature of at least 80% of the new capabilities it plans for each Major Upgrade at least 120 days before the planned release of the Major
Upgrade. An internal discussion and dispute resolution process (the “Committee Process”) will be created to facilitate such cooperation and resolve any disputes arising in connection therewith. The Committee Process shall
include:



Technology Development Committee – This four to six member committee will be made up of architects, program managers, and technical product managers from Distributor
and










Jabber. This group will determine the convergence process for Distributor-created software, seek to define common technology direction for Jabber Major Upgrades, and negotiate any differences in the prioritization,
technical approach, and validity of any change desired by Distributor or planned by Jabber. Any items that are not able to be resolved by this committee and that are considered by either party to be significant will be placed before the Technology
Steering Committee for a best efforts attempt at resolution,



Technology Steering Committee – This four to six member committee will be made up of senior- and executive-level technology personnel from Distributor and Jabber. This group will provide
long-term strategic direction to the Technology Development Committee. The Technology Steering Committee will also seek to resolve any items of disagreement presented it by the Technology Development Committee. Any items that are not able to be
resolved by this committee and that are considered by either party to be significant will be placed before the Executive Committee for a best efforts attempt at resolution,



Executive Committee – This committee will be made up of one top-level executive from each of Distributor and Jabber. The Executive Committee is responsible for all aspects of the
relationship between Distributor and Jabber, and will use best efforts to resolve any items of disagreement presented it by the Technology Steering Committee.



The parties agree to actively pursue in good faith and to exhaust all remedies afforded by the Committee Process.



5.	 	Amendment to Section 21. The first sentence of Section 21 of the Agreement is revised to read as follows:



“Any and all assignment of rights or delegation of obligations under this Agreement by Distributor to any party other than an Affiliate, as defined in Section 3(iv) of this Agreement, provided that for purposes of
this Section 21, control is represented by ownership of 50% or more of the voting securities of a company, are void without the express, prior written consent of Jabber.”



6.	 	Amendment to Section 33. The second sentence of Section 33 of the Agreement is revised to read as follows:



“The Parties agree to allow the use of each other’s names and official logos for promotional and publicity purposes including, without limitation, on marketing collateral and media kits and listings on web
pages; provided that Jabber will not issue any press announcements regarding this Agreement without Distributor’s prior written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.



7.	 	Amendment to Exhibit B. The last sentence of Exhibit B is amended and restated as follows:










The Distributor’s Products shall mean any Product in which the Software is embedded in order to provide Instant Messaging (IM) services to Mobile, B-to-B and ISP and Public customers (as such terms are defined in
Exhibit D hereto).


6.       Amendment to Exhibit D.
Exhibit D, including Attachment D-1, of the Agreement is deleted and amended and restated in its entirety to read as set forth in the attachment hereto.
7.       Governing Law. Section 27 of the Agreement, “Governing Law,” is expressly incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof.

8.       No Third-Party Beneficiaries. The provisions of this Amendment
are for the exclusive benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted assigns. Nothing contained in this Agreement will be deemed to create any third-party beneficiaries or confer any benefit or rights on or to any person not a party hereto, and
no person not a party hereto (including without limitation customers, suppliers or creditors of either party) shall be entitled to enforce any provisions hereof or exercise any rights hereunder.
9.       Definitions. All capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meaning
ascribed to them in the Agreement.
10.      Effect of Amendment. Except as
modified by this Amendment, the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. In the event of any conflict between this Amendment and the Agreement, this Amendment shall prevail.







11.      Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed
simultaneously in one or more counterparts, any one of which need not contain the signatures of more than one party, but all such counterparts taken together shall constitute one and the same Amendment. This Amendment may be delivered by facsimile,

8. Quality Assurance, Copy Protection, Packaging Artwork and Promotional Materials

LICENSOR shall provide UBISOFT with the Packaging Artwork, instruction manual, images and design, marketing materials and other collateral printed materials (if any) relative to the Game in English language. LICENSOR shall provide UBISOFT with the instructional manual, in Word format. The Packaging Artwork and Promotional Materials shall be provided by LICENSOR to UBISOFT no later than August 8th, 2005. In the event LICENSOR fails to deliver such elements by that date, the Advance Against Royalties shall be reduced by 1% (one percent) per period of 7 (seven) days of late delivery.





UBISOFT may use textual and/or pictorial matter pertaining to the Game and/or to the Trademarks on such advertising, promotional and marketing materials as may, in UBISOFT’s judgment, promote the sale of the Game within the Territory.





UBISOFT may change the Packaging Artwork of the Game in order to better adapt the Packaging Artwork to the market of the Territory, subject to LICENSOR’s prior approval – such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. LICENSOR shall notify in writing its decision to UBISOFT within 5 (five) days of LICENSOR’s receipt of UBISOFT’s request. In the event LICENSOR does not render its decision within this 5-day period, LICENSOR shall be deemed to have given their approval.





9. Marketing





UBISOFT will take care of all customer support in the Territory. LICENSOR shall promptly provide support to UBISOFT upon UBISOFT’s request to allow UBISOFT to handle customer and dealer support for the Game in the Territory. Should any additional costs be borne by UBISOFT with respect to the customer support of the Game as a consequence of a serious Bug in the Game, UBISOFT shall invoice such additional costs to LICENSOR.





10. Statements and payments





10.1 Within 45 (forty five) days after the end of every calendar quarter following commercial release of the Game, UBISOFT shall furnish to LICENSOR a complete and accurate statement in the currency set forth in the Specific Terms recording any sale of the Game occurred within the quarter.





Royalties are payable on the number of copies of the Game sold less the number of returns. UBISOFT may maintain and withhold from payment Royalties shown to have accrued on any statement reasonable reserves (not exceeding 20%) of the Royalties payable in respect of each quarter in respect of units which may be returned and will subsequently make adjustments based on the number of units actually returned provided that any unused reserve shall be released within the subsequent 180 (one hundred and eighty) days. In the event net reserves are insufficient to cover units returned in any period UBISOFT may deduct from any Royalties that accrue in such or any subsequent period an amount equal to such deficit. In the event in any quarter the Royalties paid to LICENSOR exceed the subsequent amount of actual returns, thus leading to a Royalty overpayment, LICENSOR shall promptly upon UBISOFT’s request refund
such overpayment to UBISOFT. Any objection to a statement shall be deemed waived unless made within one (1) year of the date of reception of the statement.





10.2 LICENSOR may appoint an independent Chartered Accountant registered on the list of “Certified Public Accountant” to examine UBISOFT’s sales records for the preceding four (4) full quarters for the sole purpose of checking the exactness of the statements mentioned herein. The independent Chartered Accountant (a) shall be reasonably acceptable to UBISOFT and (b) may not be compensated on a contingency basis or otherwise have financial interest in the outcome of such audit. The audit shall take place at UBISOFT’s place of business in the United States for North American sales and at UBISOFT’s principal place of business in France for other sales. Such audit shall be carried out at the expense of LICENSOR and not more than once every year. The Chartered Accountant shall not make any copies of the documents provided by UBISOFT. The dates and terms of intervention of the Chartered
Accountant must be fixed by mutual agreement between the Parties. The Parties agree that the audit shall take place no less than forty-five (45) days from prior to or after the half-yearly closing dates of UBISOFT’s accounts. LICENSOR shall provide UBISOFT with the report of the Chartered Accountant promptly following the end of the audit. If UBISOFT disagrees with such report, UBISOFT shall have the right to produce a counter-report on audited transactions. In the event the audit reveals that UBISOFT underpaid the royalties payable with respect to the period for which the audit was performed by an amount in excess of five percent (5%) of the amount owed, the reasonable cost of such inspection (not exceeding $10,000) shall be borne by UBISOFT.





10.3 Payments to be made by UBISOFT pursuant to this Agreement will be made through wire transfer within 10 (ten) business days of UBISOFT’s receipt of a corresponding invoice.

9.1 If a third party makes a claim against SFX that the Software infringes any U.S. patent, copyright, or trademark or misappropriates any trade secret (“IP Claim”); Viggle will (a) defend SFX against the IP Claim at Viggle’s cost and expense, and (b) indemnify and hold SFX harmless against any and all costs, damages and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) finally awarded against SFX by a court of competent jurisdiction or agreed to in a written settlement agreement signed by Viggle arising out of such IP Claim; provided that: (i) SFX promptly notifies Viggle in writing no later than ninety (90) days after SFX’s receipt of notification of a potential claim, provided that any failure to provide such notice Viggle shall limit Viggle’s foregoing obligations only to the extent that Viggle is prejudiced by such delay; (ii) Viggle may assume sole control of the defense of such claim and all related settlement negotiations, provided that SFX may in its sole discretion and cost, participate in its defense through its counsel; and (iii) SFX provides Viggle, at Viggle’s request and expense, with the assistance, information and authority necessary to perform Viggle’s obligations under this Section.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Viggle shall have no liability for any claim of infringement based on (w) the use of a superseded or altered release of Software if the infringement would have been avoided by the use of a current unaltered release of the Software, (x) the modification of Software by anyone other than Viggle, (y) the use of the Software other than in accordance with the Documentation and this Agreement and Technical Requirements, or (z) use of the Software in combination with any other software, hardware or data where in the absence of such combination the Software would not have been infringing.

Additionally, if a Receiving Party is ordered by a court, administrative agency, regulatory agency, or other governmental body of competent jurisdiction to disclose Confidential Information, or if it is served with or otherwise becomes aware of a motion or similar request that such an order be issued, then the Receiving Party will not be liable to the Disclosing Party for disclosure of Confidential Information required by such order, provided that the Receiving party first notifies the Disclosing Party of the motion or order by the most expeditious possible means and permits the Disclosing Party an opportunity to seek a protective order or injunction prohibiting or restricting such disclosure





10.2 Restrictions on Use of Confidential Information.  Receiving Party agrees to use reasonable care, but in all events at least the same degree of care that it uses to protect its own confidential and proprietary information of similar importance, to prevent the unauthorized use, disclosure, or availability of Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party.

6


















10.2.1 disclose, duplicate, copy, transmit or otherwise disseminate in any manner whatsoever any Confidential Information of the Receiving Party;





10.2.2 use the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for the Receiving Party’s own benefit or that of any third party or for any purpose other than performance of this Agreement;





10.2.3 commercially exploit any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party; or

10.3 Exceptions to Confidential Treatment.  Confidential Information shall not include, and the obligations herein shall not apply to, information that





10.3.1 is now or subsequently becomes generally available to the public through no fault of Receiving Party;





10.3.2 Receiving Party can demonstrate was rightfully in its possession prior to disclosure to Receiving Party by Disclosing Party;





10.3.3 is independently developed by Receiving Party without the use of any Confidential Information provided by Disclosing Party; or





10.3.4 Receiving Party rightfully obtains from a third party (without restriction and without breach of any agreement) who has the right, without obligation to Disclosing Party, to transfer or disclose such information.





10.4 Return of Confidential Information. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, upon termination of this Agreement, or upon the Disclosing Party’s earlier request, the Receiving Party shall promptly return to the Disclosing Party, or destroy, all of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information then in the Receiving Party’s possession, except for any data retained by SFX pursuant to its automatic back-up/retention policy. The Receiving Party shall, if requested in writing, certify its respective compliance with the foregoing provision.





10.5 Injunctive Relief.  It is agreed that the unauthorized use or disclosure of any Confidential Information by Receiving Party in violation of this Agreement may cause severe and irreparable damage to Disclosing Party, for which monetary damages may be insufficient.  In the event of any violation of this Agreement, Receiving Party agrees that Disclosing Party may, without posting a bond, seek from any court of competent jurisdiction preliminary and/or permanent injunctive relief to prevent disclosure and/or to prohibit further disclosure.





11. MISCELLANEOUS





11.1 Assignment.  Except as otherwise provided in this Section 11.1, neither party may assign this Agreement, and SFX may not transfer Software, to another legal entity, without the other party's written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, that no consent shall be required if (a) either party assigns this Agreement to an Affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets, unless the Affiliate or surviving entity is a direct competitor of the other party, and so long as: (i) such Affiliate or surviving entity agrees to be bound in writing by the terms of this Agreement, and (ii) the assigning or transferring entity provides the other party with notice of the assignment or transfer and the Affiliate or surviving entity’s written assent to the terms of this Agreement within thirty days of the assignment or transfer, or (b) Viggle assigns its right to receive and collect payments hereunder.

11.4 Severability.  If a provision of the Agreement or portion thereof is found to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall be omitted from the Agreement without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of the Agreement. The waiver by either party of any default or breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent default or breach.





11.5 Force Majeure.  Each party will be excused from performance for any period during which, and to the extent that, it or its subcontractor(s) is prevented from performing any obligation or service, in whole or in part, as a result of causes beyond its reasonable control, and without its fault or negligence, including without limitation, acts of God, strikes, lockouts, riots, acts of war, epidemics, communication line failures, and power failures.

11.7 Nonsolicitation.  Except if agreed to in writing by Viggle, SFX shall not contract or employ any current or former Viggle employee(s), either directly or through a third party, to work with products or services developed, provided, sold or licensed by Viggle.  Contracting or employing a current or former Viggle employee to perform any implementation, customization, configuration or support on Viggle products or services is expressly prohibited by this clause. Such prohibition shall be binding until one (1) year after the date of the applicable current or former employee’s termination of employment with Viggle.

11.10 Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in two (2) or more counterparts, each of which will be considered an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.  The exchange of digital copies of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

nonexclusive, nontransferable, royalty-free license, without right of sublicense

provisions at least as restrictive as the following, which:

(a)   Disclaim  MicroStrategy's  liability  for  damages,  whether
direct or indirect,  incidental or consequential,  arising from the use of the
Software.
(b)   Require end users to use a  commercially  reasonable  degree
of  care  to  protect  the  Confidential   Information  of  MicroStrategy  and
prohibit  Users  from,  directly  or  indirectly,  (1) using any  Confidential
Information of MicroStrategy  to create any computer  software program or user
documentation which is substantially  similar to any Software, or (2) using or
disclosing Confidential Information of MicroStrategy.

(c)   The User License Agreement shall not cause  MicroStrategy to
be liable for any taxes or duties,  however  designated  or levied  (including

provisions  set forth in this Section upon ninety (90) days'  advance  written

6.1  Indemnification  of SDC  International.  MSTR  International  II shall
defend and  indemnify  SDC  International,  against  and hold SDC  International
harmless  from any and all claims that the  MicroStrategy  Platform  infringes a

International:  (i) promptly  notifies MSTR  International  II in writing of any
such  claim;  (ii)  allows  MSTR  International  II to have sole  control of the
defense  and all  related  settlement  negotiations;  and  (iii)  provides  MSTR

its  sole  option:  (i) obtain  for   SDC  International  a  license to continue
using  the  MicroStrategy   Platform   product,   (ii)  replace  or  modify  the
MicroStrategy  Platform product so that it becomes noninfringing while retaining
substantially  similar  functionality;  or (iii) if neither  (i) nor (ii) can be

(including  the SDC  International  software and  services) or for other than an
intended  purpose as set forth in the User  Documentation,  or arising  from any
alteration or modification of the MicroStrategy  Platform product,  if the claim
would not have arisen without such alteration or modification.

6.3  Indemnification  of MSTR  International  II. SDC  International  shall
defend and indemnify  MSTR  International  II (including  paying all  reasonable
attorneys' fees and costs of litigation)  against and hold MSTR International II
harmless  from  any and  all  claims  by any  other  party  resulting  from  SDC
International's  negligent or tortious  acts,  omissions  or  misrepresentations
relating to the marketing, sublicensing, distribution, demonstration, evaluation
or use of the MicroStrategy Platform products,  regardless of the form of action
provided that MSTR  International II: (i) promptly notifies SDC International in
writing of any such claim; (ii) allows SDC International to have sole control of
the defense and all related  settlement  negotiations;  and (iii)  provides  SDC
International  with the  information,  authority  and  assistance  necessary  to
perform SDC International's obligations under this Section.

dispute to a sole  mediator  selected  by the  parties  or, at any time at the
option  of a party,  to  mediation  by the  American  Arbitration  Association
(""AAA"").  If not  thus  resolved,  it shall  be  referred  to a panel of three
arbitrators  selected by the parties within thirty (30) days of the mediation,
or in the  absence  of such  selection,  to AAA  arbitration  which  shall  be
governed by the United  States  Arbitration  Act. The ruling of any such panel

as is deemed  equitable,  just and  within the scope of this  Agreement;  (ii)
shall be with  findings  as to issues  (including  but not  limited  to patent
validity  and/or  infringement)  or a statement of the  reasoning on which the
award  rests;  (iii)  may  in  appropriate  circumstances  include  injunctive
relief;  (iv) shall be made within four (4) months of the  appointment  of the

deemed a waiver of any  right of  termination  under  this  Agreement  and the
arbitrator  is now  empowered to act or make any award other than based solely
on the rights and obligations of the parties prior to any such termination.

(d)   The arbitrator shall determine  issues of arbitrability  but
may not limit, expand or otherwise modify the terms of this Agreement.

(e)   This Agreement  shall be interpreted in accordance  with the
laws  of the  Commonwealth  of  Virginia  exclusive  of its  conflict  of laws
provisions and the place of mediation and arbitration shall be Fairfax County.

(f)   Each party shall bear its own expenses but those  related to
the  compensation  and expenses of the mediator and arbitrator  shall be borne
equally.

9.2 Relationship Between Parties. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
be construed as creating a joint  venture,  partnership,  agency,  or employment
relationship  between the Parties, and neither Party will have the right to bind
the other or incur any obligation on the

6
<PAGE>

other's behalf without the other's prior written consent.

9.3 Waiver.  The  failure of either  Party to  exercise  any right  granted
herein or to require any performance of any term of this Agreement or the waiver
by either Party of any breach of this Agreement,  shall not prevent a subsequent
exercise  or  enforcement  of the term or be deemed a waiver  of any  subsequent
breach of the same or any other term of this Agreement.

9.4 Headings. The section headings appearing in this Agreement are inserted
only as a  matter  of  convenience  and in no way  define,  limit,  construe  or
describe  the scope or intent of any such  section  nor in any way  affect  this
Agreement.

written  consent  of the  other  party.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing  to the
contrary,  either party may assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder to
any one or more of its  Subsidiaries.  Each  party  acknowledges  that it  shall
continue to be  obligated if and to the extent that a permitted  assignee  under
this paragraph  fails to perform the  obligations  that such party has assigned.
Any attempted assignment in violation of this paragraph without consent shall be
null and void.

9.6 Entire  Agreement.  This  Agreement  and the exhibits  attached  hereto
constitute  the  complete,  final and  exclusive  understanding  of the  Parties
regarding the subject matter hereof and cancels and supersedes any and all prior
negotiations,  correspondence,  understandings  and agreements,  whether oral or

upon the signing of this Agreement to the extent Greate Bay is not in

""Collector"" Logic Board shall be placed in Escrow as provided in Paragraph 7 of
this Agreement.  During the term of this Agreement, ACSC shall make available to
Greate Bay upon their completion copies of all modifications, improvements, or
updates (""Updates"") to the Software and/or the SMS at the same time or prior to
the date on which ACSC makes such updates available to other customers of ACSC,
and shall further provide Greate Bay no later than 10 days after request by
Greate Bay, with copies of the Source Code for such Updates and revised copies
of the Source Code for the entire Software and SMS which includes the Source
Code for such Updates.  Greate Bay shall have the right within the Licensed
Facilities or at other locations authorized under this Agreement to full and
unfettered use of the Source Code and may permanently install and maintain the
Source Code in its computer system for its own internal use.

(d) Provision of Hardware and Maintenance and Support Services.
During the term of this Agreement and as may be requested by Greate Bay from
time to time, ACSC shall provide Greate Bay, with SMS Hardware Components and
Support Services for Software and SMS.  Support Services means providing
Updates, Required Additions and/or Changes (as defined below), providing Error
Corrections (as hereinafter defined) in the Software and/or SMS and/or in the
communication between the Software and/or SMS and other systems covered by this
Agreement or as may be mutually agreed upon the parties, providing telephone
support and providing programming and project management services and such other
services as may be required via telephone and at Licensed Facilities to install,
integrate, maintain and support the Software and SMS.  The term Required
Additions and/or Changes means all changes and additions that must be made to
Software and/or SMS to keep it in compliance with statutory,

<PAGE>

regulatory, and accounting practices changes. The term Error Correction means a
modification, change or improvement to the Software or SMS that corrects an
Error (as defined below). The term Error means a defect, deficiency or other
problem with the Software or SMS that causes the Software or SMS to fail to
operate in accordance with the documentation for the Software or SMS, to produce
incorrect results, to damage data, to incorrectly store, retrieve, sort, present
or calculate data, or to have a commercially unacceptable response time (i.e.
time from input to producing a response). ACSC agrees that when Greate Bay
reports an Error, ACSC will immediately commence work on an Error Correction and
provide an Error Correction (i) as soon as reasonably possible if no
commercially acceptable workaround is available to Great Bay or (ii) within a
reasonable period of time if a commercially acceptable workaround is available
or (iii) with the next Update or release of the Software or SMS if the Error is
cosmetic or not material to the use of the Software or the SMS. ACSC agrees to
provide Required Additions and/or Changes no later than two weeks prior to the
effective date of such statutory, regulatory and/or accounting practices
changes.

(e) Provision of Supplier Lists.  Upon the signing of this Agreement,
ACSC shall provide Greate Bay with a list of SMS Hardware component suppliers
and shall, upon any addition or change to such supplier list, provide Greate Bay
with an updated list.  In consideration of being provided with a list of SMS
Hardware component suppliers, Greate Bay promises not to purchase SMS Hardware
components directly from such suppliers absent a default by ACSC of its
obligations under this Paragraph 6.

(f) Equitable Remedies.  The obligations of ACSC in this Paragraph 6
shall be specifically enforceable and ACSC agrees that (i) any breach of ACSC's
obligations under this Paragraph 6 would cause irreparable injury to Greate Bay;
(ii) Greate Bay would have an inadequate remedy at law for any such breach;
(iii) the balance of interests and hardships would favor an injunction in favor
of Greate Bay; (iv) the public interest would favor an injunction in favor of
Greate Bay, and (v) ACSC will make no legal arguments that equitable relief is
not an appropriate remedy in favor of Greate Bay in the event of a breach of
ACSC's obligations under this Paragraph.

7.   ESCROW OF THE ""COLLECTOR"" LOGIC BOARD SOURCE CODE.  The Escrow Agent
for the Source Code for the operating system of the ""Collector"" Logic Board
shall be Greate Bay's General Counsel.  ACSC shall cause the Source Code for the
operating system of the ""Collector"" Logic Board to be deposited with the Escrow
Agent within seven (7) days of signing this Agreement.  The Escrow Agent shall
acknowledge receipt of the Source Code and shall keep same in a safe secure
location.  Except as set forth below, the Escrow Agent shall not allow or permit
any party or third party to have access to, copies of or information concerning
the Source Code held in escrow.  Upon receipt of written certification

<PAGE>

from Greate Bay's Vice President-MIS that ACSC has either ceased doing business
and there is no successor in interest that has assumed the obligations of ACSC
or that ACSC is in default of its obligations under this Agreement, the Escrow
Agent shall release the escrowed material to Greate Bay solely for the purpose
of allowing Greate Bay to provide itself with support services and to effect the
repair, replacement, maintenance and/or debugging of the ""Collector"" Logic Board
as determined by Greate Bay.

8.   INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY WARRANTIES.  INDEMNIFICATION.  ACSC represents
and warrants that ACSC knows of no fact, circumstance or claim that the exercise
of rights pursuant to this Agreement would infringe any valid and subsisting
intellectual property right owned by any other persons.  Greate Bay acknowledges
and understands that Greate Bay must obtain licenses for the serial or other
protocols from the respective game manufacturers necessary to interface the
Software and the SMS with the games of each manufacturer.  ACSC will defend at
its expense or settle at its option, any action brought against Greate Bay to
the extent that it is based on a claim that the Software, the SMS Hardware or
the SMS Software or the Configuration, as used within the scope of this
Agreement, infringes any copyright or United States patent.  ACSC will pay any
attorneys' fees, costs and damages awarded against or incurred by Greate Bay in
such actions which are attributable to such claim provided that Greate Bay
notifies ACSC in writing of the claim within five (5) calendar days of the
service or other notification of such claim upon Greate Bay and ACSC fully
controls the defense and settlement of such claims.  Should the Software or the
SMS or the SMS Software or the Configuration become, or, in ACSC's opinion, be
likely to become the subject of a claim of infringement of a copyright or
patent, ACSC may procure for Greate Bay the right to continue using the
Software, the SMS or the SMS Software or the Configuration or replace or modify
the Software, the SMS or the SMS Software or the Configuration to make it non-
infringing, provided that no such replacement or modification shall decrease or
adversely change the performance of the Software or SMS or the Configuration and
further provided that no such replacement or modification shall cause Error.
ACSC shall have no liability for any claim of copyright or patent infringement
based on the use or combination of the Software, the SMS, SMS Software or the
Configuration with programs or data not supplied by ACSC.  Any indemnity
provided herein shall not exceed and shall expressly be limited to Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00).

OF

<PAGE>

DEALING. IN ADDITION, ACSC EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION TO

derivative modifications or extensions at the Licensed Facilities, except as
provided in the next sentence.  With respect to the Electronic Drop feature of
the SMS (""EDrop""), ACSC will submit the EDropcode for approval, provided the
applicable gaming authority has authorized implementation of EDrop on a
conceptual basis either by established policy or published regulation.  If
approval of EDrop has been so authorized by the applicable gaming authority,
ACSC will conform the logic of the EDrop code to any applicable and generally
applied specifications of the gaming authority.  Greate Bay agrees that it is
solely responsible for all testing and internal control compliance with respect
to the SMS, including, but not limited to, security of the computer system
external to the SMS; provided, however, that ACSC agrees to provide any
reasonable assistance requested of it by Greate Bay with respect to testing and
internal control compliance.

10.  CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY INFORMATION.

(a) Confidential/Propriety Information.  The parties acknowledge that
the Software, the SMS, the Source Code and all other information supplied by
ACSC in connection with this Agreement, including but not limited to any know-
how or expertise, (collectively, the ""Confidential Information""), will be deemed
confidential/proprietary information of ACSC.  Greate Bay agrees that it shall
maintain the Confidential Information under secure conditions, using reasonable
security measures and in any event not less than the same security procedures
used by Greate Bay for the protection of its own confidential/proprietary
information.

(b)  Non-disclosure Obligation.  Except as may be requested or
required by or on behalf of any gaming authority, Greate Bay shall not disclose
any Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written
consent of ACSC.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Greate Bay may make the
Software or the SMS Software available, without ACSC's prior express consent, to
any independent consultant or consulting group retained by Greate Bay solely for
purposes specifically related to Greate Bay's permitted use, operation and
application of the Software or the SMS, but only after such independent
consultant or consulting group has executed a written confidentiality agreement
pursuant to which it covenants to not use the Confidential Information except
for Greate Bay as permitted herein and to not

<PAGE>

disclose the Confidential Information under the same conditions of
confidentiality contained herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Greate Bay may
disclose appropriate portions of Confidential Information to those of its
personnel who have a need to know the specific information in question in
connection with Greate Bay's rights or the performance of obligations under this
Agreement. All such personnel will be instructed by Greate Bay that the
Confidential Information is subject to the obligation of confidentiality set
forth by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Greate Bay may disclose
Confidential Information to an entity that is not a competitor of ACSC and is
offering (i) a Plan of Reorganization in the Chapter 11 Proceeding or (ii) to
purchase control of Greate Bay, provided however, that any such entity shall
enter into a non-disclosure agreement that requires such entity to protect such
information in the same manner as is required by this Paragraph 10.

(c) Equitable Remedies.  The obligations of Greate Bay in this
Paragraph 10 shall be specifically enforceable and Greate Bay agrees that (i)
any breach of Greate Bay's obligations under this Paragraph 10 would cause
irreparable injury to ACSC; (ii) ACSC would have an inadequate remedy at law for
any such breach; (iii) the balance of interests and hardships would favor an
injunction in favor of ACSC; (iv) the public interest would favor an injunction
in favor of ACSC, and (v) Greate Bay will make no legal arguments that equitable
relief is not an appropriate remedy in favor of ACSC in the event of a breach of
Greate Bay's obligations under this Paragraph.

11.  EXCLUSION OF INCIDENTAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.  NEITHER PARTY WILL
BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY (NOR TO ANY PERSON CLAIMING RIGHTS DERIVED FROM THE
OTHER PARTY'S RIGHTS) FOR INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR
EXEMPLARY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, including lost profits or revenue, loss of
business, or other economic damage, and further including injury to property, AS
A RESULT OF BREACH OF ANY WARRANTY OR OTHER TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS
OF WHETHER THE PARTY LIABLE OR ALLEGEDLY LIABLE WAS ADVISED OR HAD OTHER REASON
TO KNOW OR IN FACT KNEW OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.  Independent of, severable
from, and to be enforced independently of any other enforceable or unenforceable
provision of this Agreement, IN NO EVENT SHALL ACSC's AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO
GREATE BAY (INCLUDING TO ANY PERSON OR PERSONS WHOSE CLAIM OR CLAIMS ARE BASED
ON OR DERIVED FROM A RIGHT OR RIGHT CLAIMED BY GREATE BAY), WITH RESPECT TO ANY
AND ALL CLAIMS AT ANY AND ALL TIMES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THE SUBJECT
MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT, IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED ONE MILLION
DOLLARS ($1,000,000.00).

<PAGE>

12.  SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE.  The obligations of Greate Bay in this Agreement
shall be specifically enforceable by ACSC and Greate Bay agrees that (i) any
breach of Greate Bay's obligations under this Agreement would cause irreparable
injury to ACSC; (ii) ACSC would have an inadequate remedy at law for any such
breach; (iii) the balance of interests and hardships would favor an injunction
in favor of ACSC; (iv) the public interest would favor an injunction in favor of
ACSC, and (v) Greate Bay will make no legal arguments that equitable relief is
not an appropriate remedy in favor of ACSC in the event of a breach of Greate
Bay's obligations under this Agreement.

13.  ASSIGNMENT.  Greate Bay may not assign any right under this Agreement
and any purported assignment will be null and void and a breach of this
Agreement.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a change of control of
Greate Bay shall not constitute an assignment, and Greate Bay shall have the
right to assign its rights under this Agreement to any person or entity
acquiring substantially all of the assets of Greate Bay or at least 51 percent
of the equity of Greate Bay through purchase, merger, or reorganization and any
such person shall in turn have the right to assign to any other person coming
within the exception provided in this sentence.  ACSC shall have the right to
assign its rights under this Agreement provided that any such assignee shall
expressly assume ACSC's obligations to Greate Bay pursuant to this Agreement and
that the assignment shall include sufficient Intellectual Property, personnel
and other know how such that ACSC can reasonably expect the Assignee to be able
to fulfill the obligations to Greate Bay under this Agreement.

14.  AUTHORITY.  Each party represents and warrants to the other that each
party respectively has full right, power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and the person executing this Agreement on its behalf has actual
authority to do so.

15.  PARTIAL INVALIDITY.  If any one or more of the provisions of this
Agreement should be ruled wholly or partly invalid or unenforceable by a court

EXHIBIT ""D""

CASINO SALES AND MARKETING SYSTEM


ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT

This module provides the ""housekeeping"" functions required to maintain an
accurate data bank of patron information for marketing purposes.  It also
serves to reduce cost specifically for the direct mail marketing
application and purging of inactive patrons.

EXTRACT MANAGEMENT

This is a flexible and robust patron selection module used primarily to
target specific segments of patrons for various marketing and/or analysis
functions.  The results of these extracts may be directed towards numerous
forms of processing.

GROUPS/INVITATION SYSTEM

The primary purpose of the group system is to enable the analysis of
profitability, both actual and potential, for up to twenty (20) user
defined groups or event types.  Expenses and/or complementaries may be
charged direct to a patrons account or as a percentage of theoretical
across all players within the group.  Groups may also include Branch
Offices and Junket Representatives with the ability to compute commissions.
Historical analysis by group type or monthly rep performance is provided.
The invitation module enables the booking of patrons responses to specific
events (i.e. Head liner shows).  Blocking of an event enables analysis
based on invited segment(s).

SWEEPSTAKES SYSTEM

The sweepstakes system provided for the controlling and winner selection
electronically for various promotional sweepstakes.  Entries earned by
patrons are automatically recorded with randomized winner selection based
on event, date and time of day.  If required entries may require pre-

EXHIBIT ""E""

TABLE MARKETING SYSTEM

TABLE MARKETING SYSTEM (TMS)
TMS was developed as an extension of the SMS for table games and utilizes
the same network and controller boards (with function keypads and mark
sense printers).  The primary purposes of TMS consist of: a) control of
complementaries at the table games; b) access to patron information for
ratings, credit and tracking of cash transactions; and c) time and
attendance for pit personnel.
<PAGE>

EXHIBIT ""F""

CASINO ANALYSIS
This system provides the analysis department with information on patrons
gaming history.  Data extraction options allow flexibility in selecting
patron segments for analysis, and an interface to the Group system allows
group analysis.  Data can be interpreted in report format, or downloaded to
a PC for analysis utilizing PC based software, i.e. Foxpro.  Selections
from PC analysis can also be uploaded to the AS/400 to drive the Sales &
Marketing extract system.

MIS RESOURCE REQUEST SYSTEM
The MIS Resource Request system allows the entry and tracking of requests
for maintenance and new requests for Software, Hardware, and other services
provided by MIS.  The system utilizes control files to allow flexibility in
establishing Application areas and allows tracking of the progress of a
request from initial request entry through completion.  For Software
revisions, the system incorporates source and object movement to control
the development/testing cycle and movement to a production environment.
Tracking and reporting of man hours by request is also available.

SECURITY INCIDENT REPORTING SYSTEM
This system provides for the entry of Security Incident data to allow
tracking and reporting of various types of incidents.  Incidents can be
tracked from initiation through closure, and some limited claim/settlement
tracking is provided.

CROSS SYSTEM BACKUP (CSB)
This application is used in a multiple CPU environment to provide a 'hot'
backup capability, for use in the event of a severe hardware failure.  CSB
utilizes the Journaling feature of the AS/400 to capture changes to
designated application system files on a CPU, and transmits the changes to
another CPU, where the CSB application on this CPU applies the changes to
the application files residing on that CPU.

EXHIBIT 10.02

SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT

This Software License Agreement (the ""Agreement"") is made and entered into as of
this 18th day of February, 2000 (the ""Effective Date""), by and between Summus,
Ltd., a Delaware corporation (""Licensor""), and High Speed Net Solutions, Inc., a
Florida corporation (""Customer""), with reference to the following facts and
circumstances:

A. Licensor has developed certain software programs and anticipates developing
certain software programs and will promote licensing of such programs through
the distribution of materials substantially in the form as those attached to
this Agreement as Exhibit A.1 (""Description Materials""). In reliance on such
Description Materials, Customer desires to license such software.

B. Licensor and Customer envision a close working relationship with respect to
Licensor's software such that Customer anticipates regularly: (i) acting as a
beta-version user of Licensor's software; (ii) providing prospective licensees
for Licensor's software; and (iii) providing references for or demonstrations of
Licensor's software. Licensor desires to create an incentive for Customer to
participate in these activities and, as such, Customer desires that Licensor
share with Customer revenues received from third party users of Licensor's
software and pay Customer for certain agency activities. To effect these
incentives, Licensor and Customer have entered into a Revenue Sharing Agreement
simultaneously with executing this Agreement.

C. Licensor desires to grant certain software license rights to Customer in
return for certain fees and on the terms and conditions contained in this
Agreement.

NOW THEREFORE, based on the above premises and in consideration of the mutual
covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties agree as follows:

any copyright, patent, trademark, service mark, or other proprietary legend
(""Proprietary Legends"") on either the Licensed Software or Documentation.
Furthermore, Customer shall include such Proprietary Legends in any
reproductions of either the Licensed Software or Documentation that Customer is
permitted to make. Customer's obligation under this Section 8.2 shall survive
the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason.

9.       INDEMNIFICATION.

9.1 SCOPE. Licensor shall indemnify and hold harmless Customer, and its
directors, officers, employees, agents, successors, assigns, licensees and
customers against any and all claims, penalties, losses, liabilities, judgments,
settlements, awards, damages and costs (including but not limited to reasonable
legal fees, expert witness fees and expenses) arising out of or related to any
claim of patent, trademark or copyright infringement and claims of unfair
competition or trade secret violation, and any other claim arising out of the
sale, possessions or use of the Licensed Software (collectively ""Claims"") and
will reimburse Customer from time to time for any reasonable legal fees, expert
witness fees or other expenses (including the reasonable value of the services
of in-house counsel) reasonably incurred by Customer in connection with
investigating any such action or Claim as such expenses are incurred.

Customer shall indemnify and hold harmless Licensor, and its directors,
officers, employees, agents, successors, assignees, licensees and customers
against any and all claims, penalties, losses, liabilities, judgements,
settlements, awards, damages and costs (including but not limited to reasonable
legal fees, experts witness fees and expenses) arising out of or related to its
use of the Licensed Software, except for Claims covered by the preceding
paragraph, unless such Claims are Excepted Claims (as defined below). Customer
expressly indemnifies Licensor for any and all claims, penalties, losses,
liabilities, judgements, settlements, awards, damages, and costs (including but

Licensor may elect to (i) obtain the right of continued use of Licensed
Software, or part thereof, which is alleged to be infringing, or (ii) replace or
modify the Licensed Software, or part thereof, so as to avoid such Claim and
thereupon Customer shall cease to use the version of the Licensed Software, or
part thereof, that was replaced or modified. Licensor will not be obligated to
indemnify, defend or settle any Claim resulting from or related to any
additions, modifications, or changes to the Licensed Software made by Customer,

respect thereto. Customer may participate in such defense at its own expense
subject at all times to Licensor's right to control the defense of the
proceeding.

9.3 FAILURE OF INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS. If for any reason the
foregoing indemnification is unavailable to Customer or insufficient to hold it
harmless, then Licensor shall reimburse Customer for all amounts paid or payable

costs of defending against any Claims because of Licensor's failure to provide
the defense specified in Section 9.2 above.

and 9.2 above is conditioned upon the indemnified party (i) promptly notifying
the indemnifying party in writing of any Claim, (ii) providing the indemnifying
party with all reasonable assistance for the defense or settlement of such
Claims, (iii) with respect to Claims, Customer granting to Licensor reasonable
authority and control for the defense or settlement of such Claims, and (iv)
each party fully observing all material terms and conditions of this Agreement.

obtained against Customer, Licensor will, at Licensor's option and expense,
either (i) procure for Customer the right to continue using the Licensed
Software or (ii) replace or modify the infringing portion of the Licensed
Software so that it becomes non-infringing yet functionally equivalent, or, if
the foregoing options are not available without undue expense, or (iii) refund
all monies paid by Customer to Licensor with respect to that portion of the
Designated Activities affected by such injunction under this Agreement; provided
that any such procurement, modification or refund by Licensor will not relieve
it of any other liability under this Agreement.

10.2 CONFORMITY TO REPRESENTATIONS. Licensor represents and warrants
that the Licensed Software is in material compliance with all specifications and
all other statements or claims found in the Description Materials of Licensor
given in Exhibit A.1, and found in the Documentation. The Documentation fully

warrants and covenants that the Licensed Software delivered under this Agreement
shall contain no Viruses. Licensor hereby represents, warrants and covenants
that the Licensed Software does not and will not contain any computer code that

destruct mechanisms (sometimes referred to as ""time bombs"", ""time locks"", or
""drop dead"" devices) or that would permit Licensor to access the Licensed
Software to cause such disablement or impairment (sometimes referred to as a
""trap door"" device). Licensor agrees that in the event of a breach or alleged
breach of this Section 10.5 that Customer shall not have an adequate remedy at
law, including monetary damages, and that Customer shall consequently be

all remedies to which Licensor shall be entitled.

10.6 MOST FAVORED CUSTOMER. Licensor represents and warrants that,
taken in the aggregate, all prices, charges, benefits, credits, warranties and

entity for the Licensed Software, maintenance for the Licensed Software, and
Documentation covered by this Agreement. If at any time during this Agreement,
Licensor shall contract with any other person or entity for (a) license fees for
service bureau use of Licensed Software; (b) maintenance fees for maintenance of
licensed software; (c) warranty and/or indemnity terms; or (d) prices, charges,

of such more favorable provisions and Customer, at its option, may require that
such more favorable provisions be available to Customer under this Agreement or
the Software Maintenance Agreement.

<PAGE>   10

THE PARTY LIABLE OR ALLEGEDLY LIABLE WAS ADVISED, HAD REASON TO KNOW, OR IN FACT
KNEW OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.

12.      ESCROW AGREEMENT.

12.1 FORM OF ESCROW AGREEMENT. The parties hereto will promptly upon
the execution of this Agreement enter into an escrow agreement in a form
substantially similar to the one attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A.4

13.      CONFIDENTIALITY. This Article 13 sets forth the procedures by which
information regarded as confidential by one party hereto (a ""Disclosing Party"")
may be disclosed to the other party hereto (the ""Receiving Party"").

13.1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND EXCLUSIONS. During the term of this
Agreement and at all times thereafter, the parties will not, except as permitted
by the terms of this Agreements, disclose or use, either for itself or for the
benefit of any third party (whether in competition with Licensor of Customer or
otherwise), any confidential information of the other party or its business or
affairs, nor will any party assist any person or entity other than the
Disclosing Party to secure any benefit from such confidential information. Any
oral, written, graphic, or electronically transmitted information not generally
available to the public shall be construed as confidential for purposes of this
Agreement, which information shall include, without limitation, information
relating to a Disclosing Party's products, processes, techniques, technology,
formulas, research data, passwords, passcodes, user identification numbers,
e-mail addresses, programming methods, know-how, trade secrets, customers and
suppliers, information relating to sales and profits, other financial data, and
the terms and conditions of this Agreements. All such information shall be
collectively referred to herein as ""Confidential Information."" The provisions of
this paragraph, however, shall not prevent the Receiving Party from use or
disclosure of information (i) as necessary in the ordinary course of such
party's performance under this Agreement, (ii) that is in the public domain
(other than information in the public domain as a result of a violation of this
Agreement by the Receiving Party), (iii) that the Receiving Party can

<PAGE>   11

demonstrate that it acquired outside of its affiliation with the disclosing
Party from a third party in rightful possession of such information and who was
not prohibited from disclosing such information, or (iv) disclosure of which is
required by law or court order. The parties acknowledge that the Object Code of
generally available versions of the Licensed Software are not required to be
treated as Confidential Information, but that Object Code of versions not
generally available to the public of Licensed Software will be Confidential
Information. In the event that the Receiving Party is requested or required (by
oral question or request for information or documents in any legal proceeding,
interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or similar process) to
disclose Confidential Information, the Receiving Party will notify the
Disclosing Party promptly of such request or requirement so that the Disclosing
Party may seek an appropriate protective order, and if, in the absence of a
protective order, the Receiving Party is, on the advice of counsel, compelled to
disclose any Confidential Information to any tribunal or else stand liable for
contempt, the Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to such
tribunal; provided, however, that the Receiving Party shall use its best efforts
to obtain an order or other assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information required to be
disclosed. Customer shall be entitled to file this Agreement as an exhibit to
one or more filings with the SEC, as recommended by its counsel, in which case
Customer shall consult with Licensor concerning the redaction of terms of this
Agreement under a confidentiality request associated with such filing, but the
implementation of any such redaction shall be at the SEC's discretion. The
obligation of confidentiality stated above shall survive termination of this
Agreement.

14.2 DEFAULT. Subject to the dispute resolution procedures set forth in

days after receipt of written notice from the non-defaulting party, unless such
breach cannot by its nature be cured, in which event the defaulting party shall
be deemed in default hereof upon the occurrence of such breach. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if Customer shall be in breach of its obligation to make any

reasonable instructions for its licensees concerning actions licensees of the
Licensed Software should take to comply with all Export Laws prior to exporting
the Licensed Software, whether by remote access or otherwise, to a destination
outside the United States. Customer shall comply with Licensor's reasonable
instructions concerning such Export Laws. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, Customer agrees not to export, directly or indirectly, any
United States source technical data acquired from Licensor or any products
utilizing such data to any countries outside of the United States, if such
export would be in violation of the United States Export Control Laws or
Regulations then in effect.

16.      SALES TAXES; SHIPPING; RISK OF LOSS. In addition to all other amounts
due to Licensor hereunder, Customer shall pay to or reimburse Licensor for all

or similar taxes or assessments, based on the License Fee(s) or other charges
payable hereunder, the Licensed Software's use, or services performed hereunder.
Customer shall have the right to contest the imposition of any such taxes or
assessments and Licensor shall provide Customer with reasonable cooperation in
contesting such taxes or assessments. Licensor shall, however, pay for all
shipping or transportation costs for delivery of all Licensed Software and all

permitted assigns and legal representatives.

17.6 NON-WAIVER. A failure of any party hereto to exercise any right
given to it hereunder, or to insist upon strict compliance by another party of
any obligation hereunder, shall not constitute a waiver of the first party's

be deemed a continuing waiver so as to impair the aggrieved party's rights in
respect to any subsequent default of the same or a different nature.

jurisdiction, the remainder of this Agreement shall nonetheless remain in full

EXHIBIT A.1

LICENSOR'S DESCRIPTION MATERIALS

MAXXSYSTEM SUMMARY

The Summus Ltd. online advertising microcast media product suite,
MaxxSystem, provides digital content management solutions for targeted
media distribution. The product suite establishes an easily integrated
infrastructure to increase the effectiveness of digital advertising,
direct marketing, campaigns and content distribution. While these
products showcase the benefits of faster wavelet technology, they also
integrate well with existing media compression, streaming and
manipulation tools in the marketplace. In addition, other forms of
media such as flash, animations, and audio content will be fully
integrated into the product suite over time.

These products are based on a `permission marketing' approach.
Customers opt in to participate and are encouraged to do so because
they have self-solicited interest in the content provided. The user
experience is enhanced through faster downloads and adaptive
transmission of media to the user's environment. All media is
distributed through a single player, regardless of media type. The
player can be customized (`re-skinned') to meet the needs of the
client.

The MaxxSystem product suite version 1.0 will have five components.
Refer to the diagram below for more information:

1.       MAXXNOTE Version 2.5 - this is the currently
available Summus video e-mail software. MaxxNote
allows the user to import, create and compress
content, bundle a player, then e-mail it via a MAPI
compliant software program to distribution lists.
MaxxNote Version 2.5 is available for Windows
95/98/NT

2.       The MAXXAD itself - this will be the advertisement
that is built and sent to an end user via e-mail.
MAXXADS are targeted e-mails that encapsulate rich
media (images, video, slide shows, text) with
electronic commerce capabilities, web site referrals
and campaign effectiveness measurement collection. A
maxxAd is rendered directly in an e-mail, therefore
no executable (.exe) files are sent. The MaxxAd
contains content and code streamed to the client on
demand. MaxxAd Version 1.0 will be available for
Windows 95/98/NT.

3.       MAXXSHOW Version 1.0 is a completely integrated media
presentation, designed to be launched from a web
site. It encapsulates rich media (images, video,
slide shows, text) with electronic commerce
capabilities, web site referrals and e-commerce sales
effectiveness measurement collection. MaxxShow is
rendered directly from product selection on a web
page, delivered via caching (release 1) and streaming
based on bandwidth (release 2). MaxxShow is available
for the Windows NT/95/98 platforms with support for
Internet Explorer 4.0, Netscape 4.05 and AOL 4.0
browsers and above. Support for the Macintosh
platform is planned for late 2Q00.

<PAGE>   18

4.       The MAXXSERVER infrastructure - MaxxServer will
stream and cache JAVA-code and media content to
MaxxAd. The server will collect and process
measurement information, handle opt-in and opt-outs,
integrate with existing online advertising tools and
process e-commerce transactions and links to web
sites. Additionally, the MaxxServer infrastructure
may handle forwarding of MaxxAdvertisements to ensure
measurement tracking for forwarded MaxxAds is counted
and measured. As needed, advertisements will be
cached for faster rendering and distribution of
content.

5.       The MAXXORCHESTRATOR product will allow the content
creators to format existing content into MaxxAds,
allowing them to combine text, images, slide shows
and video into a compelling advertisement utilizing
the benefits of Summus wavelet technology or
inserting banners and flash as required. It will
allow the user to test the MaxxAd and request
distribution through an e-mail list server.
MaxxOrchestrator Version 1.0 will be available for
Windows 98/NT

The MaxxSystem also includes related Reader Software to the extent not
included above.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES

1. With respect to any dispute or disagreement between the parties arising out
of this Agreement other than a claim for rescission of the Agreement (a
""Disputed Matter""), the following internal mediation procedures shall be
followed:

(a) Either party shall have the right to submit a Disputed Matter to
Licensor's Chief Operating Officer and Customer's Chief Operating Officer or
such other senior executives as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties from
time to time. Such submission shall be delivered to such executives for both
parties in writing with a reasonably detailed explanation of the nature of the
Disputed Matter and its impact on the obligations under the Agreement. If such
executives do not agree upon a decision within fifteen (15) business days after
submission of the Disputed Matter to them by the party submitting the Disputed
Matter, then

(b) The Disputed Matter may be escalated by either party by submitting
it to Licensor's Chief Executive Officer and Customer's Chief Executive Officer
or such other senior executives as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties
from time to time. If such senior executives do not agree upon a decision within
ten (10) business days after submission of the Disputed Matter to them, then

(c) either party may initiate the binding arbitration procedures set
forth below.

ARBITRATION PROVISIONS

1. Rules; Jurisdiction. Any Disputed Matter shall be settled by final and
binding arbitration in the County of Wake, and, except as herein specifically
stated, in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American
Arbitration Association (""AAA Rules"") then in effect, subject to the provisions
of the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. ss. 1 et seq. (""Title 9""). To the
extent the AAA Rules conflict with, or are supplemented by, the provisions of
Title 9, the provisions of Title 9 shall govern and be applicable. However, in
all events these Arbitration Provisions shall govern over any conflicting rules
which may now or hereafter be contained in either the AAA Rules or Title 9. Any
judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court
having jurisdiction of the subject matter thereof. The arbitrators shall have
the authority to grant any equitable and legal remedies that would be available
in any judicial proceeding instituted to resolve a disputed matter. The parties
hereby submit to the in personam jurisdiction of the Superior Court of the State
of North Carolina and the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of
North Carolina for purposes of confirming any such award and entering judgment
thereon.

2. Compensation of Arbitrators. Any such arbitration shall be conducted before a
panel of three arbitrators who shall be compensated for their services at a rate
to be determined by the parties, or lacking such determination by the American

<PAGE>   23

Arbitration Association, but based upon normal and reasonable hourly or daily
consulting rates for the neutral arbitrator in the event the parties are not
able to agree upon his or her rate of compensation.

3. Selection of Arbitrators. Within five (5) business days of notice by a party
seeking arbitration under this provision, the party requesting arbitration shall
appoint one person as an arbitrator and within fifteen (15) business days
thereafter the other party shall appoint the second arbitrator. Within twenty
(20) business days after the appointment of the second arbitrator, the two
arbitrators so chosen shall mutually agree upon the selection of the third
impartial and neutral arbitrator, who must be a partner or principal of a
nationally recognized firm of independent certified public accountants from the
management advisory services department (or comparable department or group) of
such firm; provided, however, that such firm cannot be the firm of certified
public accountants then auditing the books and records of either party or
providing management or advisory services for either party.

In the event the chosen arbitrators cannot agree upon the selection of the third
arbitrator, the AAA Rules for the selection of such an arbitrator shall be
followed, except that the selection shall be from such departments or groups and
certified accounting firms as are described in the immediately preceding
paragraph. If the other party shall fail to designate the second arbitrator, the
sole arbitrator appointed shall have the power to appoint, in his or her sole
discretion, both the second and third arbitrators. If a party fails to appoint a
successor to its appointed arbitrator within ten (10) business days of the
death, resignation or other incapacity of such arbitrator, the remaining two
arbitrators shall appoint such successor. The majority decision of the
arbitrators will be final and conclusive upon the parties hereto.

4. Payment of Costs. Each party hereby agrees to pay one-half (1/2) of the
compensation to be paid to the arbitrators in any such arbitration and one-half
(1/2) of the costs of transcripts and other expenses of the arbitration
proceedings; provided, however, that the prevailing party in any arbitration
shall be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and costs, arbitrators' fees
and costs, fees and costs of expert witnesses and all other costs of arbitration
(including the reasonable value of the services of in-house counsel) to be paid
by the losing party.

5. Evidence and Discovery. The arbitrators shall be instructed to conduct the
arbitration in as expeditious a manner as reasonably possibly, consistent with
the parties' intention to have a full and fair hearing on the merits of the
dispute. Each party agrees to supply the arbitrators in accordance with a
timetable to be established by the arbitrators such materials as the arbitrators
may reasonably require in order to render a decision, including those requested
by either party which the arbitrators determine are appropriate to consider, but
subject to appropriate claims of privilege. Each party shall supply to the other
party hereto copies of any and all materials which are supplied to the
arbitrators concurrently with delivery of such materials to the arbitrators.
Upon the written request of either party, the arbitrators shall conduct a
hearing at which representatives of both parties shall have the right to be
present and to make oral presentations to the arbitrators. Each party shall
supply to the other party at least twenty (20) business days prior to the
commencement of any arbitration proceeding copies of any and all documents which
such party intends to introduce or upon which such party intends to rely in
connection with such proceeding, as well as a list of any and all witnesses
whose testimony such party intends to introduce in connection with such
proceeding. Additional documents or witnesses may be introduced only if the

<PAGE>   24

arbitrators determine that good cause has been shown. Deposing of witnesses in
advance of such proceeding shall be permitted to the extent determined by the
arbitrators. Each party shall also have the right to submit written briefs to
the arbitrators in accordance with a timetable to be established by the
arbitrators. To the extent either party maintains in good faith that any
documents submitted or testimony introduced in connection with such arbitration
contain confidential information or trade secrets, the parties shall negotiate
in good faith in an effort to reach agreement regarding terms and conditions for
keeping such materials and testimony confidential. If the parties are unable to
agree upon such terms, the arbitrators shall have the right to impose
appropriate restrictions to maintain the confidentiality of any confidential
information or trade secrets in connection with the arbitration.

6. Burden of Proof. For any claim submitted to arbitration, the burden of proof
shall be as it would be if the claim were litigated in a judicial proceeding.
All testimony of witnesses shall be taken under oath and shall be subject to the
Federal Rules of Evidence.

7. Judgment. Upon the conclusion of any arbitration proceedings, hereunder, the
arbitrators shall render findings of fact and conclusions of law and a written
opinion setting forth the basis and reasons for any decision reached by them and
shall deliver such documents to each party to the Agreement along with a signed
copy of the award.

8. Terms of Arbitration. The arbitrators chosen in accordance with these
provisions shall not have the power to alter, amend or otherwise affect the
terms of these arbitration provisions or the provisions of the Agreement. 9.
Exclusive Remedy. Except as specifically provided in this exhibit or in the
agreement to which it is attached, arbitration shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the parties for any disputed matter arising out of such agreement.

9. Exclusive Remedy. Except as specifically provided in this exhibit or in the
agreement to which it is attached, arbitration shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the parties for any disputed matter arising out of such agreement.

prescription claims that are eligible for rebates processing (“Eligible Paid Claims”) as follows:




a) Provision of Software and Hosting Infrastructure:


$[       ]* per Eligible Paid Claim — for first [       ]* Eligible Paid Claims per calendar year
(minimum of $[       ]* per month). However, the minimum will not apply until the entire NMHC book
of business has been fully implemented; a full month of Eligible Paid Claims has been processed in
production mode through the Software.



$[       ]* per Eligible Paid Claim — for each additional Eligible Paid Claim over [       ]* per
year.



Eligible Paid Claims will only include those claims that are eligible for rebates processing.
Certain types of claims including, but not limited to claims for cash discount card programs are
not eligible for rebates processing and will be filtered out of processing through the Software.
All ineligible claims of this nature will be excluded from the counts of Eligible Paid Claims and
will not incur any fees whether they are filtered out by NMHC before sending to inPharmative or
filtered out by inPharmative during processing by the Software.



This fee will be waived for the claims processed for the period January 1, 2007 through June 30,
2007 for the Medicare Part D business segment, provided that NMHC pays the rebate contract
administration services fee for that period in accordance with the terms outlined below.



In the event that there are significant industry events and/or significant changes in NMHC’s
business that materially reduce revenues available to NMHC from processing rebates then the parties
will negotiate in good faith to reduce or eliminate the minimum fee as defined above. If such an
event occurs and the total NMHC Eligible Paid Claims falls below [       ]* per year, then the fee
will be the actual count of Eligible Paid Claims times the applicable per claim fee and the minimum
fee will not apply.

2.1     License Grant. Penn hereby grants to Licensee and its Affiliates, to the extent Penn has the right to do so, a license to use, copy, perform, display, distribute, modify and prepare derivative works based on the Penn Software, with the qualified right to sublicense in the United States and throughout the world to the extent permitted under Section 2.4. Penn shall use reasonable and diligent efforts to obtain in writing, within thirty (30) days following the Effective Date, appropriate assignments of all copyright and other interests in the Penn Software from Drs. Klein, DeGrado and Saven, and such other persons in their laboratories who developed any material portions of thereof. To the extent that any Affiliate exercises any rights granted by Penn hereunder, Licensee remains primarily liable to Penn for the duties and obligations of any Affiliate hereunder, and any act or omission of an Affiliate would be deemed to be a breach by Licensee of this Agreement. Licensee will produce on all copies of the Penn Software a valid copyright notice. No other rights or licenses are granted except as expressly set forth herein.

2.2     Exclusivity. The License is non-exclusive, but Penn shall not grant any additional licenses to the Penn Software to any other persons or entities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Penn may use the Penn Software solely for educational and non-commercial research purposes and for Penn’s internal business purposes. Upon request, Licensee agrees to sublicense the Penn Software (excluding, to the extent applicable, any of the new software described in Section 2.5) to other academic investigators solely for their use in conducting educational and non-commercial research, said sublicenses to be granted on such terms and conditions as are reasonably acceptable to Licensee.

2.3     U.S. Government Rights. Licensee or its Affiliates acknowledge that pursuant to Public Laws 96-517, 97-256 and 98-620, codified at 35 U.S.C. 200-212, the United States government retains certain rights in intellectual property funded in whole or part under any contract, grant or similar agreement with a Federal agency. Pursuant to these laws, the government may impose certain requirements regarding such intellectual property, including but not limited to the requirement that products resulting from such intellectual property sold in the United States must be substantially manufactured in the United States. The License is expressly subject to all applicable United States government rights as provided in the above-mentioned laws and any regulations issued under those laws, as those laws or regulations may be amended from time to time.











2.4     Sublicense Conditions. The right to sublicense granted to Licensee under Section 2.1 is subject to the following conditions:

2.4.1     Licensee may sublicense the rights granted in this Agreement by written sublicense agreement which form shall (a) prohibit the sublicensee (“Sublicensee”) from further sublicensing, (b) require that the Sublicensee be subject to the applicable terms and conditions of the license granted to Licensee under this Agreement, and (c) to the extent separate license fees are paid for sublicense rights to the Penn Software, disclaim all consequential damages as to claims with respect to the Penn Software and limit liability to no more than the actual license fees paid by the Sublicense for such sublicense rights (each, a “Sublicense”).

2.4.2     Within thirty (30) days after Licensee enters into any Sublicense: (a) Licensee must deliver to Penn a complete copy of the Sublicense (after redacting any confidential information that is not reasonably relevant to Penn’s administration of this Agreement) written in the English language (Penn’s receipt of the Sublicense shall not constitute an approval of the Sublicense or a waiver of any of Penn’s rights or Licensee’s obligations under this Agreement); (b) an executed assignment and security agreement in form acceptable to Penn (each, a “Sublicense Royalty Assignment”) granting Penn, as security for the payment of Licensee’s obligations hereunder, an assignment of and security interest in any royalties, fees or other proceeds generated by such Sublicense, exercisable upon occurrence and during the continuance of a Default under Section 5.2; and (c) such executed forms of UCC-1 and UCC-3 or other documents as may be necessary to perfect Penn’s interest in such Sublicense Royalty Assignment. In addition to any rights or remedies provided for under this Agreement, Penn shall have all of the rights and remedies of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code. Upon request, Licensee shall execute all such documents as are reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect in any jurisdiction Penn’s interest in and to such Sublicense Royalty Assignment. If Licensee fails to execute such documents in a timely manner, Licensee hereby grants Penn, effective during the period during which this Agreement or any Sublicense is in effect, an irrevocable power of attorney to execute in the name of Licensee all such documents as are reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect in any jurisdiction Penn’s interest in and to such Sublicensee Royalty Assignment. Penn hereby agrees that its assignment of and security interest in such royalties, fees and other proceeds shall be subordinated to any security interest and/or assignment that Licensee may grant to any lender to Licensee, and Penn shall execute and deliver any such documents as may be reasonably requested by Licensee to confirm and document the foregoing. Upon satisfaction of Licensee’s payment obligations hereunder, Penn shall execute such UCC termination statements with respect to the Sublicensee Royalty Assignment as Licensee shall reasonably request.

2.4.3     In the event of the continuance of a Default under Section 5.2 hereunder, all payments then or thereafter due to Licensee or its Affiliates from each Sublicensee shall, upon notice from Penn to any such Sublicensee, become owed directly to Penn for the account of Licensee or its Affiliate; provided that Penn shall remit to Licensee or its Affiliate the amount by which such payments in the aggregate exceed the total amount owed by Licensee to Penn.











2.4.4     Even if Licensee enters into Sublicenses, Licensee remains primarily liable to Penn for all of Licensee’s duties and obligations contained in this Agreement, and any act or omission of an Affiliate or Sublicensee that would be a breach of this Agreement if performed by Licensee shall be deemed to be a breach by Licensee of this Agreement.

2.5     New Software.

2.5.1     In the event that software is developed in the Penn labs of Drs. Klein, DeGrado or Saven that is a modification, improvement or enhancement to the Penn Software, Penn shall notify Licensee within 45 days after becoming aware of such development. Licensee shall within 30 days notify Penn that Licensee desires to obtain a license to such software. If Licensee so elects, then Penn and Licensee shall promptly thereafter negotiate in good faith for Licensee to take a license such software under terms substantially the same as those set forth herein; provided, however, that no additional consideration shall be payable to Penn in connection therewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, Penn reserves the right to renegotiate in good faith the consideration payable to Penn as it pertains to such software as may be required to protect Penn’s tax exempt status under the provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.

2.5.2     Penn shall not be obligated to license any software to Licensee under this Section 2.5 to the extent it is obligated to license such software to another party by reason of a sponsored research agreement entered into with such other party; provided, however, that Penn shall in good faith negotiate with Licensee for Licensee to sponsor any research that is specifically directed towards the development of software that is a modification or improvement to the Penn Software for a period of at least 150 days prior to entering into any such sponsored research agreement with another party. Any such sponsored research agreement with Penn that is specifically directed towards the development of software covered by this Section 2.5 shall require the payment of no more than “nominal” consideration to Penn.

2.5.3     If the parties are unable to agree on the terms of a license and Penn subsequently licenses any such software to a third party, Penn shall promptly reimburse Licensee for all costs and expenses that Licensee has paid to Penn in connection with the filing and prosecution of any copyright or other registrations with respect to such software.

2.5.4     The rights described in this Section will expire as to any software developed (as determined based on invention disclosure submissions to Penn) after the fifth anniversary of the Effective Date, or the date of a Change of Control, whichever occurs sooner.

2.6     Additional Provisions for Penn Software. Penn shall deliver to Penn complete copies of all of the Penn Software promptly following the Effective Date. Licensee acknowledges that the Penn Software is protected by United States copyright laws and international treaty provisions, and that Penn retains sole and exclusive title to all such copyrights. Licensee acknowledges that Penn is not in the business of commercial distribution of software, has not prepared the Penn Software for commercial distribution and does not provide any support or upgrades for the Penn Software. Licensee will devote its own resources to completing the development of the Penn Software prior to commercial distribution and to provide any services necessary to distribute the Penn Software.

5.4     Return of Confidential Information. Upon termination of this Agreement, Licensee and any Affiliate and/or Sublicensee shall, at Penn’s request, return to Penn or destroy all Confidential Information and any copies of the Penn Software in their possession or control, except as may be necessary for Licensee and any Affiliate and/or Sublicensee to exercise any of its retained rights under this Article 5. Licensee and any Affiliate and/or Sublicensee may retain one copy of Confidential Information and the Penn Software in their files for reference purposes only.

6.     INFRINGEMENT AND LITIGATION

Penn and Licensee shall consult one another in a timely manner concerning any appropriate response to the infringement, including, without limitation, whether Penn needs to join any action taken against the infringing party.

6.2     Prosecution by Licensee. Licensee may prosecute such infringement at its own expense and, if legally necessary, may join Penn as a party to such action. Licensee shall not settle or compromise any such suit in a manner that imposes any obligations or restrictions on Penn or grants any rights to the Penn Software without Penn’s prior written permission, not to be unreasonably withheld. Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.3, financial recoveries from any such litigation will first be applied to reimburse Licensee for its litigation expenditures with additional recoveries being paid to Licensee.

6.3     Intervention by Penn. Licensee’s rights under Section 6.2 are subject to the continuing right of Penn to intervene at Penn’s own expense and join Licensee in any claim or suit for infringement of any copyrights in the Penn Software. Any consideration received by Licensee in settlement of any claim or suit in which Penn has intervened shall first be applied to reimburse Licensee and Penn for their respective litigation expenditures, with additional recoveries being shared between Penn and Licensee in proportion with their share of the litigation expenses in such infringement action.











6.4     Prosecution by Penn. If Licensee fails to prosecute any infringement, then Penn may prosecute such infringement at its own expense. In such event, financial recoveries will be entirely retained by Penn.

6.5     Cooperation. In any action to enforce any copyrights in the Penn Software, either party, at the request and expense of the other party shall cooperate to the fullest extent reasonably possible. This provision shall not be construed to require either party to undertake any activities, including legal discovery, at the request of any third party except as may be required by lawful process of a court of competent jurisdiction.

7.     WARRANTIES; DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES; INDEMNIFICATION

7.1     NO ADDITIONAL WARRANTIES. THE PENN SOFTWARE LICENSED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, AND PENN MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT THERETO, EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 7.3 AND 7.4.

7.5     Indemnification. Licensee shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Penn, its trustees, officers, agents and employees (individually, an “Indemnified Party”, and collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”), from and against any and all claims, suits, actions or proceedings brought against the Indemnified Parties by any third party, and for any and all liability, loss, damage, or expense suffered or incurred by the Indemnified Parties in connection therewith (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) (individually, a “Liability”, and collectively, the “Liabilities”), that results from or arises out of: (a) the development, use, manufacture, promotion, sale or other disposition of any Penn Software by Licensee, its Affiliates, its assignees, Sublicensees, its vendors or other third parties acting under their authority; (b) any breach by Licensee or its Affiliates or Sublicensees of this Agreement; and (c) the enforcement by an Indemnified Party of this Section 7.5. Without limiting the foregoing, Licensee shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties from and against any Liabilities resulting from:

7.5.1     Any product liability or other claim of any kind related to the use by a third party of Penn Software that was manufactured, sold or otherwise disposed by Licensee, its Affiliates, its assignees, its Sublicensees, its vendors or other third parties acting under their authority;

7.5.3     Clinical trials or studies conducted by or on behalf of Licensee, its Affiliates, its assignees, its Sublicensees or their agents relating to the Penn Software, including, without limitation, any claim by or on behalf of a human subject of any such clinical trial or study, any claim arising from the procedures specified in any protocol used in any such clinical trial or study, any claim of deviation, authorized or unauthorized, from the protocols of any such clinical trial or study, and any claim resulting from or arising out of the manufacture or quality control by a third party of any substance administered in any such clinical trial or study.

7.6     Rights of Penn in Liability Action. Licensee is not permitted to settle or compromise any claim or action giving rise to Liabilities in a manner that imposes any restrictions or obligations on Penn or grants any rights to the Penn Software that are inconsistent with the rights granted to Licensee hereunder without Penn’s prior written consent. If Licensee fails or declines to assume the defense of any such claim or action within thirty (30) days after notice thereof, then Penn may assume the defense of such claim or action for the account and at the risk of Licensee. The indemnification rights of Penn or other Indemnified Party contained herein are in addition to all other rights that such Indemnified Party may have at law or in equity or otherwise.

7.7     Procedures for Indemnification. Penn shall (a) provide Licensee with prompt written notice of each claim for which any Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under Section 7.5, (b) grant Licensee sole authority to defend and/or settle each such claim using attorneys selected by it and reasonably acceptable to Penn, and (c) cooperate in all reasonable respects with Licensee in connection with its performance of such activities.

Such certificates shall provide that the insurance carrier(s) notify Penn in writing at least 30 days prior to cancellation or material change in coverage.

7.8.3     Penn may periodically review the adequacy of the minimum limits of liability insurance specified in this Section, and Penn reserves the right to require Licensee and any Affiliate to adjust the liability insurance coverages within commercially reasonable levels. Any such determination shall be made reasonably by Penn in good faith. The specified minimum insurance amounts do not constitute a limitation on the obligation of Licensee and any Affiliate to indemnify Penn under this Agreement.

8.     USE OF PENN’S NAME


Licensee
and its Affiliates and agents shall not use, and Licensee shall require its Affiliates and Sublicensees not to use, Penn’s
name or any adaptation thereof, or any Penn seal, logotype, trademark, or service mark, or the name, mark, or logotype of any Penn

9.1     No Agency. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to establish a relationship of principal and agent between Penn and Licensee or its Affiliates or Sublicensees, nor any of their agents or employees for any purpose whatsoever, nor shall this Agreement be construed as creating any other form of legal association or arrangement which would impose liability upon one party for the act or failure to act of the other party.











9.2     No Assignment. Licensee is not permitted to assign this Agreement or any part of it, either directly or by merger or other operation of law, without the prior written consent of Penn in its sole discretion.

Any prohibited assignment of this Agreement or the rights hereunder shall be null and void.

9.3     No Waiver. No waiver of any breach or condition of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a waiver of any other subsequent breach or condition, whether of like or different nature.

In the event that a party to this Agreement perceives the existence of a dispute with the other party concerning any right or duty provided for herein, the parties will, as soon as practicable, confer in an attempt to resolve the dispute.

9.7     Compliance with Laws. Licensee, its Affiliates and Sublicensees shall comply with all prevailing laws, rules and regulations that apply to its activities or obligations under this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that this Agreement may be subject to United States laws and regulations controlling the export of technical data, computer software, laboratory prototypes and other commodities, articles and information, including the Arms Export Control Act as amended in the Export Administration Act of 1979, and that the parties’ obligations are contingent upon compliance with applicable United States export laws and regulations. The transfer of certain technical data and commodities may require a license from the cognizant agency of the United States Government and/or written assurances by Licensee, its Affiliates and/or Sublicensees that Licensee shall not export data or commodities to certain foreign countries without prior approval of such agency. Penn neither represents that a license is not required nor that, if required, it will issue.

9.8     Binding Nature of Agreement. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns, except that any assignment by Licensee must comply with Section 9.2 to be effective.

9.9     Counterparts, Headings and Exhibits.

All Schedules and Exhibits hereto are hereby incorporated in this Agreement and made a part hereof.











9.10     Integration and Amendment. This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents embody the entire agreement and understanding among the parties hereto and thereto and supersede all prior agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof or thereof. This Agreement may not be changed, modified, extended or terminated except by written amendment executed by an authorized representative of each party.

9.11     Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, then such illegality, invalidity or unenforceability shall attach only to such provision and shall not in any manner affect or render illegal, invalid or unenforceable any other provision of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be carried out as if any such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision were not contained herein.

9.12     Number of Days. In computing the number of days for purposes of this Agreement, all days shall be counted, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays; provided that if the final day of any time period falls on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday on which Federal banks are or may elect to be closed, then the final day shall be deemed to be the next day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or such holiday.

9.13     Force Majeure. If the performance of any part of this Agreement by either party (other than the payment of monies due and owing hereunder) is prevented, restricted, interfered with or delayed by reason of any cause beyond the reasonable control of such party that could not, with the exercise of reasonable due diligence, have been avoided (a “Force Majeure Event”), the party so affected shall be excused from such performance to the extent of and for so long as such Force Majeure Event continues, provided that the affected party shall use all reasonable efforts to avoid or remove the causes of such Force Majeure Event with the utmost dispatch and to continue its performance under this Agreement whenever such causes are removed. When such circumstances arise, the affected party shall provide the other party with prompt notice thereof and shall regularly update the other party as to its efforts to remove the causes of such Force Majeure Event until full performance under this Agreement has resumed.














IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties, intending to be legally bound,
have caused this Agreement to be executed by their duly authorized representatives.

RESPONSE AND RESOLUTION GUIDELINES

PROBLEM SEVERITY LEVELS

Every call is assigned a severity level during its setup within the call log.
This severity level controls both the manner and speed with which the Customer
Support specialist responds back to the caller, as well as the timetable within
which the support group works to resolve the problem. All references to time
and business days refer to time and business days Eastern Standard Time.
Standard severity levels are as follows:

Critical   Highest priority classification. Assigned to problems that
prevent the bank from conducting normal business, typically
problems involving core processing failures, recurring
application crashes, and serious calculative errors.

High       Second highest priority classification. Assigned to problems
that have a serious impact on the bank's operations, but do not
prevent the bank from conducting business. Examples of
high-priority problems include nightly processing errors that
cause the bank to go out of balance, reports with incorrect
information, and inaccurate display screen calculations.

Medium     Third highest priority classification. Assigned to problems that
inconvenience the bank but do necessarily represent calculative
errors or other software failures. Typical medium-priority
problems include print routines that take longer than desired,
account setup routines that require redundant data entry, and
window options that do not properly reflect bank-defined default
values.

Low        Lowest priority classification. Assigned to problems that are
primarily cosmetic in nature (typographical errors, alignment
problems, etc.). Low-priority problems detract from the system's
elegance and polish, but not from its core functionality.

RESPONSE GUIDELINES

Following are the target response times for each level of problem severity:

Critical   A return call will be made within 45 minutes.

High       A return call will be made to the bank within 3 hours, but never
later than the end of that business day, unless calls come in
within 1 hour of the end of the business day, in which case a
return call must be made within the first 2 hours of the next
business day.

Medium     A return call will be made to the bank during the same business
day, or if the call comes within 3 hours of the end of the
business day, a return call must be made by the end of the next
business day.

Low        A return call will be made by the end of the next business day.













12
<PAGE>   13
CONFIDENTIAL


RESOLUTION GUIDELINES

Following are the target resolution timeframes for each classification. Phoenix
will use its reasonable commercial efforts to provide a code fix or a work
around for all reported problems within the following time frames. If a work
around is provided, Phoenix will provide a code fix at a later time or with the
next release of the software, if necessary. Given the uncertain nature of
troubleshooting technical software problems, however, Phoenix cannot guarantee
such time frames.

Critical   For calls logged either during or after normal support hours,
the problem should be resolved within 5 hours. Phoenix shall
involve such resources as necessary to remedy critical errors as
soon as possible, including escalating the problem to the Senior
Vice President in charge of Client Services within 1 hour.

High       For calls logged either during or after normal support hours,
the problem should be resolved within 24 hours.

Medium     Based on consultation with the bank, the problem should be
resolved either during the next scheduled software release
(preferred) or, at the bank's explicit request, within 5
business days.

Low        The problem should be resolved according to a mutually agreed
schedule.

VALIDIAN will not be liable to the LICENSEE for loss of profits, or special, indirect, incidental, consequential or exemplary damages, including costs or legal expenses, in connection with the supply, use of performance of the Software or the performance of its other obligations pursuant to Agreement, even if it is aware of the possibility of the occurrence of such damages.  In certain jurisdictions the foregoing limitations may not be effective, in which case the applicable law will prevail.

7.2

In any event, the total liability of VALIDIAN (including the licensors of products forming part of the Software) to LICENSEE for any claim under this Agreement whether it arises by statute, contract or otherwise, will not exceed the amounts paid to VALIDIAN by LICENSEE under this Agreement for the Software, Support or Services which form the subject of the claim.  The foregoing limit does not apply to the indemnity given in Section 9 or to death or personal injury arising from negligence of VALIDIAN or in respect of accidental loss of, or damage to LICENSEE’s tangible property, to the extent caused by VALIDIAN, its employees or subcontractors.  In the latter event of damage to tangible property, the limit of liability is $1,000,000 (U.S.).

9.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INDEMNIFICATION

VALIDIAN will indemnify, defend and hold LICENSEE harmless against any claims, legal actions, losses and other expenses arising out of or in connection with any claims that the Software infringes or violates any intellectual property right of any third party (“Claim”), on the condition that LICENSEE notifies VALIDIAN promptly in writing of the Claim and gives VALIDIAN sole control of the defense and negotiations for its settlement or compromise; provided, however, (i) VALIDIAN shall obtain the prior written consent of LICENSEE (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before entering into any settlement or compromise of such Claim, if the settlement or compromise does not release LICENSEE and its Affiliates from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such Claim or the settlement imposes injunctive or other equitable relief against LICENSEE or any of its Affiliates and (ii) LICENSEE shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any Claim and to employ separate counsel of its choice for such purpose.  The fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by LICENSEE.  If LICENSEE is, or may become, prohibited from continued use of any Software by reason of an actual or anticipated Claim, VALIDIAN will use its reasonable efforts to (a) obtain for LICENSEE the right to use the Software, or (b) replace or modify such Software so that it is no longer subject to a Claim, but performs the same functions in an equivalent manner.  If it cannot do so, VALIDIAN will refund to LICENSEE the unused portion of the license fees paid in respect of the Software (determined by depreciating the license fees paid on a straight-line basis over the remainder of any renewal period) and any corresponding unused fees paid in respect of Support.  VALIDIAN will have no liability for any Claim based on (i) use of















other than a prevailing release of the Software (if the Claim could have been avoided by that release and the LICENSEE has been so notified), or (ii) any use or modification of Software not approved by VALIDIAN.  THIS SECTION STATES THE ENTIRE RESPONSIBILITY OF VALIDIAN CONCERNING CLAIMS.

10.

TERM & TERMINATION

10.1

The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall be perpetual unless terminated (i) upon the breach of this Agreement by either party (the “Initial Term”) or (ii) by LICENSEE upon at least 30 days written notice to VALIDIAN.

10.2

The term and rights of termination of this Agreement and of the SSMA for breach shall be subject to and pursuant to Section 7 of the SSMA in Schedule C to this Agreement made a part hereof and incorporated by reference herein.  A party (“Terminating Party”) may, on giving written notice to the other party, terminate any this Agreement or an SSMA on written notice to the other if the other party fails to remedy a breach of any material obligation under this Agreement within thirty (30) days after receiving notice thereof from the Terminating Party.  If this Agreement or an SSMA is terminated, the parties will continue to be liable for any obligations arising, liabilities accrued or amounts payable under this Agreement or that SSMA prior to termination.  In addition to any other remedies, VALIDIAN may seek injunctive relief in respect of any breach of this Agreement by the LICENSEE (or any Affiliate).  Sections 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 12.5 will survive the termination of this Agreement.

11.

Schedule C to the Software License Agreement (""Agreement"") By and Between Validian Corporation and Ganthet Mobile Corporation dated November 16, 2016

The Software Support and Maintenance Agreement

Introduction

THIS SOFTWARE SUPPORT and MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT (“SSMA”) is entered into between VALIDIAN Corporation, referred to herein as “VALIDIAN”, and GANTHET MOBILE CORPORATION, the holder of this license, referred to herein as “LICENSEE”.

The terms of this SMA are as follows:

Section 1.  Software Maintenance Services

1.1

VALIDIAN agrees to provide to LICENSEE corrected or modified versions of the Software distributed as either patches to existing releases, or as maintenance releases or new versions of the Software that VALIDIAN makes generally available to end-users and any master keys or root keys necessary to operate and use the Software.

1.2

Such modifications, when delivered and installed, shall become part of the Software and shall otherwise be subject to all of the terms of the License Agreement to which this SSMA is incorporated by reference.

1.3

New versions are major releases of the software in which platform upgrades, substantial additional functionality or improved performance are provided.  Under this maintenance agreement, LICENSEE has the right to receive any new Realm Credentials and to upgrade their license to the new version of the software to replace existing versions as long as LICENSEE is current in payment of any fees under the License Agreement and SSMA have not been terminated.

Section 2.  Error Correction Services

2.1

VALIDIAN shall use reasonable commercial efforts to correct or provide a usable work-around solution for any Critical Error or reproducible material error in the Software, within a reasonable period of time.  VALIDIAN agrees, if feasible, to commence correction within twenty-four (24) hours after such error or malfunction is detected.  If VALIDIAN, in its discretion, requests written verification of an error or malfunction discovered by LICENSEE, LICENSEE shall promptly provide such verification, by email, fax, or overnight mail, setting forth in reasonable detail the respects in which the Software fails to perform.  An error or malfunction shall be “material” if it represents a non-conformity with VALIDIAN's current published specifications for the Software that interferes with the usability of the Software.  VALIDIAN is not obligated to fix errors that are not material.  Upon request, LICENSEE shall provide VALIDIAN remote access to LICENSEE’s computer system for the purpose of remote diagnostics.

2.2

LICENSEE shall pay VALIDIAN at VALIDIAN's then current time and material rates for work of VALIDIAN spent investigating an error or malfunction that VALIDIAN reasonably determines to have been caused by a modification to the Software not made nor authorized by VALIDIAN.















Section 3.  Telephone Support

3.1

VALIDIAN shall make reasonable email and/or telephone support available to LICENSEE's designated individual(s) who have been trained in the use of VALIDIAN software products. Email and telephone support is available between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Eastern Time (ET), Monday to Friday excluding U.S. and Canadian National Holidays, and consists of problem validation and logging, and preliminary diagnosis of the reported problem.  The intent is to identify a remedy or an avoidance procedure directly by email or over the telephone.

Section 4. Request for Modification of the Software Products

4.1

LICENSEE may at any time request that VALIDIAN make additional modifications to the Software Products to add functions or improve performance.  VALIDIAN shall respond to a request for such work with the terms on which it may be willing to undertake such work, but the decision to do so is in the sole discretion of VALIDIAN.

Section 5.  Delivery

5.1

In order to satisfy any delivery obligation, VALIDIAN may, at its option, send, have delivered to, or email to LICENSEE corrected Program(s), patches, modifications, error corrections, fixes, or releases to the Software provided pursuant to this Agreement, together with installation instructions.

Section 6. Intellectual Property

6.1

All modifications to the Software, including all intellectual property rights associated therewith, made or provided by VALIDIAN pursuant to this Agreement, whether alone or with any contribution from LICENSEE or its personnel, shall be owned exclusively by VALIDIAN and its licensors.

Section 7.  Term

7.1

This Agreement and the SSMA shall commence on the Effective Date, as set forth on page 1 of the License Agreement unless sooner terminated in accordance with this Section or the License Agreement.

7.2

VALIDIAN may terminate this Agreement and SSMA by giving written notice of termination to LICENSEE upon the occurrence of any of the following events:

LICENSEE defaults in the performance of any material requirement or obligation created by this Agreement or the License Agreement and such default is not cured within the applicable cure period;

7.3

No termination of this Agreement and SSMA shall release LICENSEE from any obligation to pay VALIDIAN any amount that has accrued or become payable at or prior to the date of termination.

Section 8.   Miscellaneous

8.1

The date on which VALIDIAN's obligations are required to be fulfilled will be extended for a period equal to the time lost by reason of any delay arising directly or indirectly from acts of God, unforeseeable circumstances, or any other cause beyond VALIDIAN's reasonable control.

8.2

A failure by either party to enforce any right under this Agreement shall not at any time constitute a waiver of such right or any other right, and shall not modify the rights or obligations of either party under this Agreement.

8.3

This Agreement shall obligate and benefit the parties, their personal representatives, heirs, successors, and assigns.  VALIDIAN may assign all or any part of this Agreement and SSMA.

8.4

The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement and SSMA shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision, the remaining provisions being deemed to continue in full force and effect.

EXHIBIT A




Asset Manager



Asset Manager, a companion “tape-cracker” product to Asset OnSite, permits field-to-field mapping
of asset and pool data from disparate sources (e.g., Excel, MS Access, DBF, ASCII, Fixed Width and
EBCDIC formats). The user interface is intuitive, mapping data elements side-by-side. The product
also automates mapping of codes and other non-standard source data to standardized table values as
well as arithmetic manipulation of values as it converts. Provisions for saving and re-use of
mapping schemes are also provided. System architecture is Visual C++ connected to Microsoft SQL
server database




Asset OnSite



Asset OnSite is a web-based portfolio management tool that can be accessed anywhere an internet
connection is available. Users can quickly analyze and stratify loan and servicing pools. Standard
reports relevant to the asset type are available to analyze every aspect of a pool utilizing the
populated data fields. Users can also easily create their own customized reports using multiple
cross-tabs, which can be saved for later use or used only once. Custom filters can be applied to
create sub-pools, which can be named and stored separately. Customized extracts allow for export to
other databases. Images of loan documents can be loaded and stored adjacent to loan level data.
System architecture is Microsoft ASP.NET connected to Microsoft SQL server database. The license
in Section 1.1 includes both the current version of Asset OnSite and the prior version, subject to
the limitation in Section 1.1 for the current version.




Busch Analytics



Busch Analytics is a sophisticated servicing analysis tool that can be used to evaluate pools of
serviced loans and generate pricing and reporting information. System architecture is Microsoft
ASP and ASP.NET connected to Microsoft SQL server database




Auction Platform



Hanover owns an auction platform, programmed by ISI (Intraprise Solutions, Inc.) that is used to
control and support the sale of assets. It provides a real-time bid-ladder that enables bidders
and sellers to see the bids as they are entered. The system is configured so that the seller can
see the bidder’s names, but the bidders can only see the bid amount. A version of this platform is
currently being used by The Debt Exchange for the FDIC. System architecture is Microsoft ASP,
ASP.NET and Adobe Flash connected to Microsoft SQL server database




Loan Performance Risk Surveillance System (LP RSS)



Hanover has created a loan surveillance system to manage the loans in our bond portfolios as well
as track delinquent loans. In addition to the main reporting modules, which create our monthly
risk books, there are several other modules such as Delinquency tracking, Static Pool Analysis,
Delinquency Trend Analysis, Disaster Monitoring and Housing Shock Analysis. The delinquency
tracking modules track the delinquent loans in our securities. The application maintains a
database of all delinquent loans, BPOs and comments and calculates expected losses based on state
specific parameters. The static pool analysis allows a user to see historical information on a
filtered set of loans. Disaster monitoring allows a user to create a disaster area and create a
collateral profile report based on the disaster area. You can also shock the portfolio and see
what effect a decline/increase in value may have on our losses. Access to the system is



A-1















granted via a user name and password that is authenticated to a database. Each user has access to
specific modules team depending upon their user roles. System architecture is Microsoft Access/VBA
Data Project and Microsoft ASP.NET connected to Microsoft SQL server database. Reports are
Microsoft Access.




Hanover Collateral Reporting System



Reporting system for creating over-concentration reports and acts as an additional report generator
for running summary stratification reports. This system also contains the filter builder which is
used throughout the Reporting system and the Surveillance System (LP RSS). The system also has the
ability to configure different counties for the addition of new criteria in the over-concentration
reports. The system can run any of the modules off of the main LP database or the LP Bidding
database. There is also a method to combine the two databases together to see what the effect
would be on the current portfolio if you purchased a new bond. Access to the system is granted via
a user name and password that is authenticated to the STARS database. The system also utilizes
forms authentication to prevent unauthorized access. System architecture is Microsoft ASP.NET /
VB.NET connected to Microsoft SQL server database. Reporting tool is Crystal Reports for .NET.




STARS



STARS (Securities Tracking and Reporting System) is a trade ticket based securities tracking and
reporting application that serves as the sub-ledger to the company’s general ledger (MS Dynamics
Solomon IV). The application maintains our B Bond and Agency inventory and provides numerous
reporting capabilities. It runs complex accounting calculations such as repo financing, discount
accretion, impairments and level yield. STARS has the ability to create transaction ledgers for
batch input into our accounting system. STARS runs a roles-based security module for access to
screens along with an approval system for all trades. A trade cannot become part of our inventory
unless it has past all stages of approval: Trader, Management and Accounting. Access to the system
is granted via a user name and password that is authenticated to a database. The system also
utilizes forms authentication to prevent unauthorized access. Passwords conform to Hanover’s
approved password policy. System architecture is Microsoft ASP.NET / VB.NET connected to Microsoft
SQL server database. Reporting tool is Crystal Reports for .NET and Microsoft Excel.




Hanover LP / Intex Vector Converter



Used as a communication tool with our internal trading vendor systems. Creates Intex ramp files
from Loan Performance Risk Model excel loss vectors. Converts AFT formatted loss arrays to Intex
ramp files. Converts Loan Performance output formats to Intex ramp files. Also used to convert
Intex cashflow text files to import into excel or into STARS for calculating level yield. Newest
version will have an internal loss model for generating loss adjusted cash flows, similar to Intex.
Access to the system is granted via a user name and password that is authenticated to the STARS
database. System architecture is Microsoft VB.NET connected to Microsoft SQL server database.




HDMF Pricing Module



The HDMF pricing module is a sophisticated cash flow generator that is used to price distressed
loan pools by taking into account projected losses and servicer advances based on state specific

EXHIBIT 10.1



APPLICATION SERVICE PROVIDER (ASP)
SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT


THIS APPLICATION SERVICE PROVIDER AGREEMENT (this ""Agreement"") is dated this
28th day of December 2001 between Stellent, Inc. (""Stellent""), a Minnesota
corporation, having its principal offices at 7777 Golden Triangle Drive, Eden
Prairie, MN 55344 and Active IQ Technologies, Inc., a Minnesota corporation with
principal offices at 601 Carlson Parkway #1550, Minnetonka, Minnesota 55305 (the
""ASP"").

THIS AGREEMENT SUPERCEDES ANY ""SHRINK-WRAP"" OR OTHER FORM OF LICENSE AGREEMENT
WHICH MAY BE PACKAGED WITH THE SOFTWARE OR INCORPORATED INTO THE MEDIA ON WHICH
THE SOFTWARE IS SHIPPED.

THE SOFTWARE IS COPYRIGHTED AND LICENSED (NOT SOLD). STELLENT DOES NOT SELL OR
TRANSFER TITLE TO THE SOFTWARE TO THE ASP. THE LICENSE GRANTED TO THE ASP UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT COMMENCE UNTIL THE ASP HAS EXECUTED THIS AGREEMENT AND
AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF STELLENT HAS RECEIVED, APPROVED, AND EXECUTED A
COPY OF IT AS EXECUTED BY THE ASP.

1.   DEFINITIONS. As used in this Agreement:

1.1.    ""Application"" shall mean online subscription based application
services of the ASP incorporating the Software and marketed to
Customers.

1.2.    ""Customer"" shall mean a person, corporation or similar entity which
has entered into a subscription agreement for the Application and
may grant to Subscribers access rights to the Application.

1.3.    ""Software"" means the object code version of Stellent's software
program(s) listed on Attachment A, together with any fixes, updates,
modifications, enhancements, and new versions (if any) as may, from
time to time, be provided as part of Stellent's support service(s).
The term ""Software"" also includes the documentation and other
written materials packaged with this Agreement, together with such
additional documentation and materials as may, from time to time, be
provided by Stellent for use in connection with the Software
(collectively, the ""Documentation"").

1.4.    ""Subscriber"" shall mean a person authorized by a Customer to access
the Application incorporating the Software for purposes of
submitting and editing managed content, and has authority to perform
standard end-user functions, including, but not limited to,
searching, viewing and printing managed content.

2.   GRANT OF LICENSE. In consideration of payment of the applicable fees as
discussed below, Stellent hereby grants to the ASP an exclusive,
sublicensable license to host the Software for itself and third parties on
the servers in its host computer system located its principal place of
business for the sole purpose of managing documents on internal and
external Web sites in accordance with the Documentation. If the ASP hosts
more than thirty (30) instances of the Software, it hereby agrees that it
will provide written notice to Stellent and shall pay to Stellent any and
all fees payable by Stellent to licensors of third party software or
applications included within the Software.

The ASP may use the services of third party agents to market the
Applications to potential Customers provided however that the Applications
shall only be hosted by the ASP or its authorized outsourcers as permitted
herein.

As used herein, ""exclusive license"" means that so long as the ASP meets the
minimum royalty commitments as described on Attachment D, Stellent shall
not, nor shall Stellent grant to another third party the right to, provide
a for profit application service provider offering during the term of this
Agreement. If a third party requests that Stellent grant to such third
party the right to provide a for profit application service provider
offering, Stellent shall refer such third party to the ASP and the ASP and
Stellent shall negotiate in good faith the amount of compensation due and
owing to Stellent for such referral. Further, Stellent agrees that during
the term of this Agreement, Stellent shall not directly solicit the
Customers with the sole intent of inducing such Customers to terminate its
use of the Applications by purchasing the software products of Stellent.
However, the foregoing shall not prevent Stellent from engaging in its
normal business practices and any such activities shall not be deemed to be
a breach of this Agreement nor entitle the ASP to any compensation
therefor.

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the
ASP acknowledges that Stellent is a party to application service provider
agreements with third parties that may provide for profit application
service provider offerings to end users and the existence of such
agreements shall constitute neither a transgression of the exclusive
license granted to the ASP herein nor entitle the ASP to receive any
compensation therefor.

backup purposes and for providing redundancy to Customers and Subscribers.

shall include any term that purports to expand any indemnity, warranty,
maintenance or other obligation or liability of Stellent under this
Agreement. The ASP shall promptly notify Stellent of any violation of a
subscription agreement of which it becomes aware, and will take
commercially reasonable efforts to enforce each subscription agreement with
at least the same degree of diligence that is uses in enforcing similar

such agreements with respect to provisions relating to the Software and
that such provisions are also enforceable by Stellent.

grant to the ASP or any third party any ownership right, title or interest

property rights in the Software are and shall remain with Stellent and/or
Stellent's suppliers. The ASP hereby agrees to reproduce the copyright and
other notices relating to the rights of Stellent and its suppliers on every
copy or partial copy of the Software that it makes. The ASP shall not
remove, obscure, or modify any such notices without Stellent's prior
written consent. The Application shall display to Subscribers certain
notices notifying the Subscribers that the Application contains Software of
Stellent. The placement and content of such notices shall be mutually
agreed upon in writing by Stellent and the ASP.

5.   PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. The ASP acknowledges that the Software
contains confidential and proprietary information and substantial and
valuable trade secrets of Stellent and its third party suppliers. The ASP
shall use the same care to protect the Software against any use, copying,
disclosure or dissemination not expressly authorized by this Agreement that
it uses to protect its own most valuable proprietary information and
materials, but in no event less than the care a reasonable business person
would use under similar circumstances. Without limiting the foregoing, the
ASP may not give any third party access to the Software other than as
explicitly set forth herein (other than as Customers or Subscribers),
except third-party contractors who need access to the Software to perform
services for the ASP and who have signed a non-disclosure agreement
agreeing to protect the confidentiality of the Software.

parties to (a) use, copy, modify, or prepare derivative works of the

covered by this Agreement, except taxes based on Stellent's net income.
Terms of payment are net thirty (30) days from date of invoice, unless
other terms have been agreed upon and made in writing and signed by a duly
authorized representative of Stellent.

8.   TERM AND TERMINATION. The license granted under this Agreement will
commence upon execution of this Agreement and shall continue in force for a
term of 3 YEARS (subject to the provisions of Attachment D). Other than as
set forth in Attachment D, this Agreement shall be renewed upon the mutual
written agreement of both parties. This Agreement may be immediately
terminated by either party after thirty (30) days written notice of
material breach and failure to correct such material breach . Upon the
termination of this Agreement, the ASP must (a) cease all use of the
Software, (b) destroy or return to Stellent all copies of the Software in

the best of its knowledge, the Software does not violate any U.S. patent,
trademark, copyright, trade secret, privacy right or other third party
intellectual property rights; and (c) that for a period of thirty (30) days
after shipment of the Software, the Software, when operated with the

warranty set forth in Paragraph 9(c) above, and as Stellent's entire
liability in contract, tort, or otherwise for a breach of section 9(c),
Stellent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to correct or cure such
defect in a reasonably timely manner by issuing corrected instructions, a
fix or a bypass, and if Stellent cannot correct or cure such defect in a
reasonably timely manner), Stellent shall refund all prepaid royalties to
ASP set forth in Section 2.2 of Attachment C. If Stellent has not corrected
such defect or error after it has had a reasonable opportunity to do so,
the ASP shall have the right to terminate this license with respect to the
defective or nonconforming module(s) of the Software, and Stellent shall
refund the amount paid by the ASP as the license fee for the defective or
nonconforming module(s) of the Software. These remedies are provided on the
condition that (a) the ASP reports the defect or error within the warranty
period and provide Stellent with information sufficient to allow Stellent
to reproduce the defect or error; (b) the ASP has not modified, misused or
damaged the Software; and (c) Stellent's examination of the Software
discloses that the defect or error actually existed. Ongoing Software
support and maintenance is available from Stellent at additional cost as
set forth on Attachment C attached hereto.

11.  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. THE WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN PARAGRAPH 9 ARE IN
LIEU OF ALL OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES ON THE PART OF STELLENT AND
ITS SUPPLIERS WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN
PARAGRAPH 9, STELLENT MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS, EXPRESS,
IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WITH RESPECT TO THE
SOFTWARE. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, STELLENT DOES NOT WARRANT THAT
THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET THE ASP'S REQUIREMENTS OR
THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE. ALL
THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND THE ASP
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ENTIRE RISK WITH RESPECT TO ITS QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE.

12.  LIMITATION ON LIABILITY. Except for claims arising out of the ASP's
indemnification obligations to Stellent or for violations of Stellent's
intellectual property rights in and to the Software, the cumulative
liability of either party for all claims relating to the Software or
arising under this Agreement, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise,
shall not exceed the total amount of all pre-paid royalty and license fees
paid by the ASP to Stellent for the Software licensed under this Agreement.
Except for claims arising out of the ASP's indemnification obligations to
Stellent or for violations of Stellent's intellectual property rights in
and to the Software, in no event shall either party or their suppliers be
liable for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential, or exemplary
damages, including without limitation, damages for lost profits or
revenues, loss of use of any software or hardware, loss of data, or
interruption of business, whether claimed in contract, tort, or otherwise,
even if Stellent is informed of the possibility of such loss or damage. The
limitations of liability set forth in this Paragraph 12 are intended to
apply without regard to whether other provisions of this Agreement have
been breached or proved ineffective and without regard to the success or
effectiveness of other remedies.

13.  INDEMNIFICATION FOR INFRINGEMENT. If a third party claims that the Software
infringes any copyright, U.S. patent, U.S. trade secret or similar U.S.
intellectual property right, and provided that the ASP is not in default
under this Agreement, Stellent shall defend the ASP against such claim at
Stellent's expense and pay all damages against the ASP; provided, however,
that the ASP shall promptly notify Stellent in writing of the claim, and
allow Stellent to control, and cooperate with Stellent in, the defense or
settlement of the claim. If such a claim is made or appears possible,
Stellent may, at its option, secure for the ASP the right to continue to
use the Software, modify or replace the Software so that it is
non-infringing but retains substantially the same functionality, or, if
neither of the foregoing options is reasonably available, require the ASP
to return the infringing module(s) of the Software for a refund equal to
the amortized value of the remaining prepaid royalties set forth in Section
2.2 of Attachment C (using a straight line sixty (60) month amortization
schedule). The foregoing notwithstanding, Stellent shall have no obligation
to indemnify the ASP for any claim (a) based on a modification or misuse of
the Software, or (b) based on the combination, operation or use of the
Software with any product, data or apparatus not specified or provided by
Stellent, if the claim would have been avoided had the Software not been
combined, operated or used with such product, data or apparatus. THIS
PARAGRAPH STATES STELLENT'S ENTIRE OBLIGATION TO THE ASP AND THE SOLE
REMEDY OF THE ASP FOR CLAIMS OF

Page 3 of 7
<PAGE>

INFRINGEMENT OR BREACH OF THE WARRANTY SET FORTH IN PARAGRAPH 9 ABOVE.

14.  INDEMNIFICATION FOR INFRINGEMENT BY THE ASP. The ASP hereby agrees to
defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Stellent and its third-party suppliers
from and against any claims, loss, liability, or damages (including, but
not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of the operation or
use of the Software and any third-party content accessed using the
Software, which is not covered by Stellent's warranty and indemnity
obligations hereunder . THE ASP'S USE OF ANY MATERIALS OBTAINED BY USE OF
THE SOFTWARE IS SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE COPYRIGHT LAWS AND NEITHER STELLENT
NOR ITS SUPPLIERS SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INFRINGEMENT.

15.  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. The ASP acknowledges that the use, copying, disclosure
or dissemination of the Software, or the trade secrets embodied therein, in
a manner not authorized by this Agreement would cause irreparable harm to
Stellent that could not be fully remedied by monetary damages. The ASP
therefore agrees that Stellent shall be entitled, in addition to any other
remedies available to it at law or in equity, to such injunctive or other
equitable relief as may be necessary or appropriate to prevent such
unauthorized use or disclosure without the necessity of proving actual or
irreparable damage by reason of any such unauthorized use, disclosure,
dissemination or copying.

16.  GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of
Minnesota and the ASP consents to personal jurisdiction and venue in
Minnesota. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
Sales of Goods is specifically excluded from application to this Agreement.
The ASP will comply with all foreign and domestic laws and will not export
or re-export the Software without the Stellent's prior written
authorization and without appropriate United States or foreign government
licenses and approvals.

17.  ASSIGNMENT. The ASP may not transfer or assign its rights or obligations
under this Agreement without Stellent's prior written consent, except that
it may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to its
successor in interest by merger, operation of law or otherwise, or to any
individual or entity that purchases the ASP's entire business, provided
such successor assumes in writing all of the ASP's obligations under this
Agreement.

18.  U.S. GOVERNMENT. If the Software is being provided to the Department of
Defense, the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release,
perform, display, or disclose shall be specified in the license customarily
provided to the public (DFARS 227.7202-4). RESTRICTED RIGHTS---In all other
cases, the Government's rights to use, duplicate, or disclose this
commercial software and related documentation is subject to the
restrictions as set forth in subparagraphs (c) (1) and (2) of Commercial

by local courier, (b) by a nationally recognized overnight courier or (c)
sent by United States certified mail, return receipt requested, postage
prepaid and addressed to the parties at their respective addresses set
forth above. Notices shall be effective upon receipt if delivered

19.  MISCELLANEOUS. No amendment to this Agreement shall be binding unless made
in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of the party
against whom enforcement is sought. Whenever the consent of a party is
required, such consent may be withheld in that party's sole and absolute
discretion. The failure of either party at any time to require performance
of any provision of this Agreement or to exercise any right provided for
herein shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision or such right. All
waivers must be in writing. Unless the written waiver contains an express
statement to the contrary, no waiver by either party of any breach of any
provision of this Agreement or of any right provided for herein shall be
construed as a waiver of any continuing or succeeding breach of such
provision, a waiver of the provision itself, or a waiver of any right under
this Agreement. All remedies provided for in this Agreement shall be
cumulative and in addition to and not in lieu of any other remedies
available to either party at law, in equity or otherwise. This Agreement
contains the entire understanding and agreement between the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all previous
communications, negotiations and agreements, whether oral or written,
between the parties with respect to such subject matter. Any obligations
that by their nature continue after the expiration of this Agreement shall
remain binding upon the parties.

last date written below, by and between SOFTWARE 2000, INC., a corporation
having a principal place of business at 25 Communications Way, Hyannis,
Massachusetts 02601, USA (""SOFTWARE 2000"") and SIMIONE CENTRAL HOLDING, INC., a
corporation having a place of business at 6650 Powers Ferry Road, Atlanta,
Georgia 30339 (""CUSTOMER"").


1.  LICENSE GRANTED.
(a) Subject to all of the limitations and conditions contained in this
Agreement, SOFTWARE 2000 grants to CUSTOMER the following non-transferable and
non-exclusive license rights to use the software system(s) described in the
attached schedule(s) (the ""Software Schedule(s)"") and any corrections,
enhancements, updates and new releases thereto which are provided generally by
SOFTWARE 2000 to its customers who are active on maintenance for the software
system(s) and are not independently priced and licensed (the software
system(s), together with any corrections, enhancements, updates and new
releases being referred to as the ""Software System(s)""), and the related system
and user documentation provided by SOFTWARE 2000.  The Software System(s) and
documentation may be used solely within North America, in the ordinary business
activities of CUSTOMER, for its internal operations only.  The Software
System(s) or portions thereof which operate on an IBM AS/400 computer may be
used only on the designated production computer specified in the Software
Schedule(s) (the ""Designated Production Computer(s)"") at the designated
production location(s) specified in the Software Schedule(s) (the ""Designated
Production Location"") The Software System(s) or portions thereof which operate
on a personal computer, if any, may be used only by the number of ""client
seats"" specified in the Software Schedule(s) (i.e. number of authorized
personal computer(s)).  The Repository (as described in the technical
documentation provided by SOFTWARE 2000) may be installed and stored only on
the number of intermediate server(s) specified in the Software Schedule(s).
(b) The Software System(s) which operate on an IBM AS/400 computer may be used
on a temporary back-up computer located at the designated production
location(s) only if the designated production computer(s) is inoperative
because of a malfunction, the performance of preventive maintenance, or
engineering changes to the designated production computer(s).
(c) The Software System(s) (i) include source code for the Software Systems(s),
with the exception of source code for certain Software System(s) or portions
thereof, and (ii) do not include class libraries for any Infinium Software
System(s).  Customer may from time to time request SOFTWARE 2000's then current
list of the Software System(s) or portions thereof for which source code and/or
class libraries are not provided.

2.  OWNERSHIP; NON-DISCLOSURE AND COPIES
CUSTOMER acknowledges that the Software System(s); all source code,
object code, class libraries, user interface screens, algorithms, development
frameworks, repository, system designs, system logic flow, and processing
techniques and procedures related thereto; any system, user, or other
documentation related thereto; any copies and derivatives of any of the
foregoing, in whole or in part; as well as all copyright, patent, trade secret
and other proprietary rights in any of the foregoing; are and shall remain the
sole and exclusive confidential property of SOFTWARE 2000 or SOFTWARE 2000's
licensor.  CUSTOMER AGREES THAT IT WILL NOT DISCLOSE OR OTHERWISE MAKE
AVAILABLE TO THIRD PARTIES THE SOFTWARE SYSTEM(S) OR RELATED DOCUMENTATION
EXCEPT WHEN DISCLOSURE IS NECESSARY TO THE CUSTOMER's PERMITTED USE HEREUNDER
OF THE SOFTWARE SYSTEM(S) AND THE THIRD PARTY AGREES TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS
CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT.  CUSTOMER shall hold as SOFTWARE 2000's
confidential property, and shall further safeguard against disclosure, all
copies of the Software System(s) in whole or in part, and all other information
furnished by SOFTWARE 2000 to CUSTOMER in connection with the Software
System(s) licensed under this Agreement or in connection with any other product
or service or proposed product or service of SOFTWARE 2000, including all
source and object code (whether provided on physical media, electronically or
otherwise), all system documentation (in any form), and the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, in the same manner as it safeguards its own
confidential property against disclosure, provided that such safeguards are at
least equal to industry standards, and shall take such steps as are reasonably
necessary to ensure that the provisions of this Agreement relating to
confidentiality and non-disclosure are not violated by any employee, agent or
other representative of CUSTOMER.  CUSTOMER shall not rent, lease, decompile,
disassemble, or reverse engineer any portion of the Software System(s).
CUSTOMER may not copy the Software System(s) without the prior written
permission of SOFTWARE 2000, except to make a copy of any program which is
required as an essential step in its utilization or to make an archival or
back-up copy of the Software System(s).  CUSTOMER shall not alter or remove any
SOFTWARE 2000 or other copyright notice from the Software System(s), the
documentation or any permitted copies thereof and shall ensure that all copies
contain any such SOFTWARE 2000 or other copyright notice.  CUSTOMER shall
indemnify and save SOFTWARE 2000 harmless from any and all damages arising out
of or in connection with a breach of this Paragraph 2, including but not
limited to the legal fees and disbursements of SOFTWARE 2000 incurred in
connection with any breach or threatened breach of this Paragraph 2.  CUSTOMER

contained herein, it shall, within ten (10) business days of learning of any
such breach, notify SOFTWARE 2000 in writing of the breach, specifying fully
the nature and manner of the breach.  CUSTOMER further agrees to cooperate fully

<PAGE>   2
3. PAYMENT; TAXES
With each Software System, CUSTOMER shall pay SOFTWARE 2000, or its agent or
designee, license and, if applicable, professional service fees in accordance
with the payment terms specified in the Software Schedule(s).  CUSTOMER shall
pay SOFTWARE 2000, within thirty (30) days of billing by SOFTWARE 2000, all
charges for travel and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by SOFTWARE 2000 in
connection with training, education or other professional services provided by
SOFTWARE 2000, and, for so long as SOFTWARE 2000 is maintaining the Software
System(s) and CUSTOMER has elected to continue such maintenance, for ongoing
maintenance fees and expenses related thereto.  CUSTOMER shall pay all taxes or
duties, fees and governmental charges, however designated, (including personal
property taxes, sales taxes, use taxes and customs duties but not including any
income or corporate excise taxes assessed against SOFTWARE 2000) arising from,
or based upon, the Software System(s) licensed hereunder, the license fee for
the Software System(s), other amounts payable under this Agreement, any services
provided under this Agreement or the operation and use of the Software
System(s), CUSTOMER shall pay SOFTWARE 2000's then current administrative fee
in connection with any transfer of a Software System from one Designated
Production Computer to another.

4. DELIVERY.
Within thirty (30) days after the date of execution of this Agreement by
SOFTWARE 2000, or such later date specified in a Software Schedule, SOFTWARE
2000 will deliver to CUSTOMER the Software System(s) and all related
documentation.

5. MODIFICATIONS.
CUSTOMER may modify the Software System(s) only in order to adapt the Software
System(s) for CUSTOMER's permitted use hereunder, provided, however, SOFTWARE
2000's maintenance and warranty obligations set forth in Paragraph 6 and 7
shall apply only to the version of the Software System(s) released generally by
SOFTWARE 2000 to its customers and not to any version which has been modified
by CUSTOMER.  If modifications are made by CUSTOMER that result in SOFTWARE
2000 being relieved of its obligation to provide maintenance services, SOFTWARE
2000 shall not be required to reimburse CUSTOMER for any prepaid maintenance.

6. MAINTENANCE SERVICES; PROFESSIONAL SERVICES. CUSTOMER may purchase
maintenance for the Software System(s) for so long as SOFTWARE 2000 continues
to maintain such Software System(s), and in accordance with SOFTWARE 2000's
then current maintenance policies.  Maintenance services do not include the
maintenance of conversion programs, interfaces or other software delivered as
part of professional services under this or any other agreement for
professional services.  Professional services will be priced on a time and
materials basis at SOFTWARE 2000's then current rates or at such other rates as
may be set forth in the Software Schedule(s) or a separate Professional
Services Agreement or similar agreement, and, at SOFTWARE 2000's discretion,
will be subject to the execution by CUSTOMER of a Professional Services
Agreement or similar agreement.  For these purposes, one (1) consulting equals
one (1) person for eight (8) hours and one (1) education credit equals one (1)
person in one (1) class for one (1) day. All professional services provided by
SOFTWARE 2000, which are not listed on a Software Schedule(s) to this Agreement
or provided under a Professional Services Agreement, including but not limited
to services provided by SOFTWARE 2000's support organization, shall be deemed
to have been provided under this Agreement.

7. WARRANTIES. (a) SOFTWARE 2000 represents and warrants that it is the lawful
owner or licensee of the Software System(s) and has full legal power and
authority to license the Software System(s) to CUSTOMER as provided in this
Agreement. (b) SOFTWARE 2000 warrants that, for as long as CUSTOMER is active
on maintenance for the Software System(s), the Software System(s) will operate
in substantial conformity with the Functional Documentation supplied by
SOFTWARE 2000 within the Software System(s) when used in strict compliance
therewith; provided, however, that any graphical user interface separately
priced and licensed hereunder (including but not limited to Infinium: Desktop
Manager) will operate only in conjunction with certain Software System(s) and
releases thereto in accordance with a list published by SOFTWARE 2000 from time
to time.  (""Functional Documentation"" is the ""help text"" and/or the ""how to""
text provided within the Software System(s).)  This warranty is contingent upon
(a) CUSTOMER's installation of all corrections, enhancements, updates, and new
releases provided by SOFTWARE 2000 to CUSTOMER as part of maintenance services
and (b) the absence of damage or abuse to the Software System(s).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, CUSTOMER acknowledges that (i) it is solely
responsible for having the appropriate compatible network(s) and operating
system environment(s), and (ii) since the Software System(s) is complex and,
therefore, may have defects, CUSTOMER'S sole and exclusive remedy for any such
defects shall be as follows:  If the Software System(s) fails to perform as
warranted, SOFTWARE 2000 shall, within a reasonable period of time, provide all
reasonable programming services to correct programming errors in the Software
System(s), or at its sole option, replace the Software System(s). (c) Any
professional services provided under this Agreement are provided ""as is""
without representation of warranty of any kind or nature. (d)  SOFTWARE 2000
may offer CUSTOMER the opportunity to license programs of third parties by
agreement between CUSTOMER and the third party (including but not limited to,
""shrink wrap"" agreements).  SOFTWARE 2000 MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY
WITH RESPECT TO SUCH PROGRAMS.  CUSTOMER agrees that SOFTWARE 2000 shall have
no responsibility or liability whatsoever with respect to such programs and
that any damage, loss, expense, claim, suit, or other problem arising in
connection with such programs shall be exclusively between CUSTOMER and such
third parties.

8.  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN PARAGRAPH 7, SOFTWARE 2000 MAKES NO WARRANTY
OR REPRESENTATION, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
ANY WARRANTIES OF QUALITY OR PERFORMANCE, OR ANY WARRANTIES OF COMPATIBILITY
WITH HARDWARE OR WITH NETWORK OR OPERATING SYSTEM ENVIRONMENTS OR WITH
NON-SOFTWARE 2000 SOFTWARE.
<PAGE>   3

9. LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY.
________ event shall Software 2000's aggregate, cumulative monetary
liability for any damages under or related to this Agreement from any cause
whatsoever, regardless of the form of action, exceed the license fees actually
paid by CUSTOMER to SOFTWARE 2000 for the applicable Software System(s).
Without affecting the applicability of the preceding sentence, in no event will
SOFTWARE 2000 or its officers, directors, affiliates, employees, agents or
representatives, be liable for loss of profits, business, use or data, nor for
interruption of business, nor for any other indirect, incidental,
consequential or punitive damages even if SOFTWARE 2000 was advised of the
possibility thereof, regardless of the form of action.

10. TERM; TERMINATION AND OTHER REMEDIES OF SOFTWARE 2000.
(a) This Agreement shall remain in effect until terminated pursuant to this
Paragraph 10.  If CUSTOMER (i) fails to pay any amount due hereunder within
thirty (30) days of the date such amount is due, (ii) breaches any of its
obligations under Paragraph 2 or the first sentence of Paragraph 11; (iii)
fails to perform any other material obligation hereunder if such failure has
not been cured within thirty (30) days after SOFTWARE 2000 has given CUSTOMER
notice of such failure; or (iv) causes or permits the winding up or liquidation
of its affairs, voluntarily, or by order of a court adjudging CUSTOMER bankrupt
or insolvent or approving as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization
of CUSTOMER, then SOFTWARE 2000 may, in its sole discretion, do all or any of
the following: terminate this Agreement and/or the license to use the Software
System(s) granted hereunder, by providing written notice to CUSTOMER, suspend
and/or terminate performance of any maintenance, professional or other
services, upon delivery of written notice to CUSTOMER, and/or disable or
deactivate the Software System(s) to the extent it is technically possible to
do so and/or refuse to issue the key or other mechanism which enables the
Software Systems(s) to operate on any computer(s), upon delivery of written
notice to CUSTOMER.
(b) Upon any termination of this Agreement and/or the license to use any
software System(s), CUSTOMER shall cease to use the Software System(s) and
shall return to SOFTWARE 2000 the Software System(s) and all copies thereof and
all proprietary and confidential property of SOFTWARE 2000, including, without
limitation, all source code, object code and documentation.  CUSTOMER shall
expunge all copies of the source code or object code from its designated single
production computer or any other computer containing such codes and shall
provide a certificate of an officer of CUSTOMER stating that all such codes
have been expunged from its computer hardware.  SOFTWARE 2000 shall also have
such other legal and equitable rights and remedies to which it may be entitled
with respect to CUSTOMER's failure to comply with the provisions of this
Agreement.  CUSTOMER agrees that Paragraphs 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of this
Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement and/or any license to
use a Software System and shall remain in full force and effect.

11. GENERAL.
CUSTOMER shall not, voluntarily or involuntarily, sublicense, sell, assign,
give or otherwise transfer the license granted hereunder, or any copies of the
Software System(s) or any other information furnished by SOFTWARE 2000 to
CUSTOMER.  This Agreement, which shall include all schedules and addenda
attached hereto or as may be executed hereafter in reference to this Agreement,
may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but
all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.  This
Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts without giving effect to the conflict of laws
principles thereof.  This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding between
the parties, is binding upon and inures to the benefit of the parties hereto and
their respective successors and may be amended only by a written instrument
executed by both an officer of SOFTWARE 2000 and by CUSTOMER.  If two or more
entities are named herein as CUSTOMER, their obligations shall be joint and
several.  This Agreement supersedes any and all prior and contemporaneous
conversations, understandings and agreements between the parties, including any
request for proposal or similar document and any responses thereto and any oral
or written information or advice given by SOFTWARE 2000, its employees, agents
or representatives, all of which are of no further force and effect, and
supersedes the terms of any and all purchase orders or invoices.  The execution
of any amendment, schedule or addenda hereto after the date of this Agreement
shall also be deemed to supersede any and all conversations, understandings and
agreements or similar documents and responses thereto and any oral or written
information or advice given by SOFTWARE 2000, its employees, agents or
representatives, which are prior to or contemporaneous with the execution of
such amendment, schedule, or addenda, and any and all purchase orders or
invoices are related thereto.  If any provision of this Agreement shall be
held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, that provision
will be enforced to delay the maximum extent permissible, and the remaining
provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.  Neither the
failure nor any delay on the part of either party to exercise any right, remedy,
power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof.  No
claim or action, regardless of form, arising out of this Agreement, other than
a claim or action relating to a breach of Paragraph 2 or the first sentence of
this Paragraph 11, may be brought by either party more than one (1) year after
the cause of action has arisen.

5  LICENSE AND SUPPORT SERVICES FEES
Licensee will pay Portal the license, services and Support Services fees as set
forth on Schedule A and in each applicable Order.

6  PAYMENTS AND TAXES
6.1  Invoices for amounts due under this Agreement shall be due and payable on
the date set forth in Schedule A or relevant Order(s). If no date is stated,
payment shall be due thirty (30) calendar days from Licensee's receipt of
invoice.

addition to any remedies Portal may have hereunder or at law, any payments more
than thirty (30) days overdue will bear a late payment fee of 1.5% per month

under applicable law, then the applicable late payment fee shall be an amount
equal to the maximum rate allowed by law, accruing from the payment due date.

6.3  Portal may suspend or terminate Support Services for non-payment continuing
for more than fifteen (15) calendar days after Licensee's receipt of a written
notice from Portal informing of the failure to pay when due. Portal shall have
no liability for damages sustained by Licensee resulting from such termination
or suspension of Support Services pursuant to this Section 6.3.

6.4  The amounts set forth in this Agreement and all Orders hereunder are
exclusive of all taxes (including without limitation, value added taxes and
withholding taxes), tariffs, duties and the like. If Portal is required to pay
any sales, use, value-added, withholding or other tax, tariff, duty, etc.,
(other than taxes on Portal's net income) on the licenses or services provided
pursuant to this Agreement or pertaining to Licensee's use of the Licensed
Software, then such taxes shall be billed to and paid by Licensee.

7  SUPPORT SERVICES
Provided Licensee has paid the applicable Support Services fees, Portal,
directly or through or its authorized agent, shall provide Licensee with
technical support services in accordance with the Support Services plan
purchased by Licensee as set forth on Schedule A. Portal reserves the right to
modify its Support Services plans any time. Portal will notify Licensee in
writing of any material modifications to Portal's Support Services plans.
Licensee shall designate one primary technical support liaison and one backup
technical support liaison who will be permitted to contact Portal during
applicable technical support services hours. Portal will support each Major
Release of the Licensed Software for at least eighteen (18) months from its
initial  commercial release (""Support Term""). Portal shall have no obligation to
support (i) Licensed Software which has been damaged due to Licensee's
negligence, abuse, or misapplication, (ii) Licensed Software which has been
modified or altered in a manner not expressly authorized by Portal, (iii)
problems caused by use of the Licensed Software other than in accordance with
the Documentation, or (iv) Licensed Software installed in an operating
environment or hardware platform other than that for which it has been designed
as set forth in the applicable Documentation. Licensee will reasonably cooperate
with Portal in the resolution of support issues and, upon Portal's request and
during normal business hours, shall provide Portal with remote access to the
equipment on which the Licensed Software is installed and/or operating. Portal
will abide by Licensee's security policies and procedures and will only use such
remote access to provide Support Services for the Licensed Software. Licensee
understands that failure to provide Portal with such remote access may result in
delayed resolution of Support Services issues. If Licensee fails to provide
Portal with the above described remote access, Portal shall have no liability
for damages arising from delays which could reasonably have been avoided had
Licensee provided Portal with above-described dial-in access. Unless cancelled
by Licensee at least sixty (60) days prior to the termination of the then
current annual Support Services term, Support Services for supported products
will automatically renew at the same support level (if available) unless
terminated by Licensee or Portal as permitted under this Agreement.

8  CONSULTING SERVICES
Subject to payment of the applicable fees, Portal will provide Licensee with the
Support Services, training services and technical account management (""TAM"")
services set forth on Schedule A. Additionally, Portal may from time to time
provide Licensed Software implementation or other professional consulting
services agreed to by both parties (""Consulting Services""). Prior to the
scheduling of such Consulting Services, Licensee and Portal will enter into a
Professional Services Agreement separate from this Agreement. Unless otherwise
agreed in writing, all Consulting Services will be billed on a time and
materials basis. Consulting Services are bid separately from the Licensed
Software licenses, and Licensee may acquire either Licensed Software licenses or
Consulting Services without acquiring the other.

9  RESTRICTED RELEASES
If Licensee is selected for participation and elects to participate in a
Restricted Release program, Licensee agrees (i) Portal shall have no obligation
to correct errors in or deliver updates to the Restricted Release, (ii) Portal
shall have no obligation to support the Restricted Release, (iii) Licensee will
provide Portal with appropriate test data for the Restricted Release if
necessary to resolve problems in the Restricted Release encountered by Licensee
and will promptly report to Portal any error discovered in the Restricted
Release, (iv) the Restricted Release is experimental, may contain problems and
errors and is being provided to Licensee on an ""AS-IS"" basis with no warranty of
any kind, express or implied, (v) neither party will be responsible to the other
for any losses, claims or damages of whatever nature, arising out of or in
connection with the performance or nonperformance of the Restricted Release,
(vi) Licensee will not use the Restricted Release in production applications
without the prior written approval of Portal, and (vii) Licensee will stop using
and return or destroy any Restricted Release promptly upon Portal's request.

10  TERMINATION
Portal may terminate a license to a Licensed Software product if Licensee fails
to pay the license fee therefor within fifteen (15) calendar days after written
notice from Portal that payment is past due. Either party may terminate this
Agreement if the other party breaches a material term of this Agreement and
fails to cure such breach within sixty (60) calendar days after receipt of
written notice describing the breach in reasonable detail. Upon termination of
this Agreement, all licenses granted hereunder shall immediately terminate,
Licensee shall immediately cease using the Licensed Software and Documentation
and Licensee shall certify in writing to Portal that all copies (in any form or
media) have been destroyed or returned to Portal. Termination shall not relieve
Licensee from paying all amounts accrued under this Agreement prior to
termination and shall not limit either party from pursuing any other available
remedies. Sections 4, 5,

Page 2 of 10
<PAGE>

6, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15.1, 17, 18 and 19 shall survive termination or expiration
of this Agreement.

11  INFRINGEMENT INDEMNITY
Portal at its own expense shall (i) defend or at its option settle, any claim or
suit against Licensee on the basis of infringement of any trademark, copyright,
trade secret or United States patent (""Intellectual Property Rights"") by the
Licensed Software or permitted use thereof, and (ii) pay any final judgment
entered against Licensee on such issue or any settlement thereof, provided (a)
Portal has sole control of the defense and/or settlement, (b) Licensee notifies
Portal promptly in writing of each such claim or suit and gives Portal all
information known to Licensee relating thereto, and (c) Licensee cooperates with
Portal in the settlement and/or defense. (Licensee shall be reimbursed for all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing any cooperation
requested by Portal.) If all or any portion of the Licensed Software is, or in
the opinion of Portal may become, the subject for any claim or suit for
infringement of any Intellectual Property Rights, Portal may, and in the event
of any adjudication that the Licensed Software or any part thereof does infringe
or if the permitted use of the Licensed Software or any part thereof is
enjoined, Portal shall, at its expense do one of the following things: (1)
procure for Licensee the right to use the Licensed Software or the affected part
thereof; (2) replace the Licensed Software or affected part with other suitable
programs; (3) modify the Licensed Software or affected part to make it non-
infringing; or (4) if Portal reasonably determines that none of the foregoing
remedies are commercially feasible, refund the aggregate payments made by
Licensee for the Licensed Software or affected part thereof. Portal shall have
no obligations under this Section 11 to the extent a claim is based upon (A) the
use of any version of the Licensed Software other than a current, unaltered
version provided by Portal, if infringement would have been avoided by a current
unaltered version; or (B) combination, operation or use of the Licensed Software
with software and/or hardware not delivered by Portal if such infringement could
have been avoided by combination, operation or use of the Licensed Software with
other software and/or hardware. This Section 11 states the entire liability of
Portal and the exclusive remedy of Licensee with respect to any alleged
infringement by the Licensed Software or any part thereof.

12  WARRANTY
12.1  For ninety (90) calendar days from the Effective Date of this Agreement
(""Warranty Period"") Portal warrants that the Licensed Software when properly
used will operate in all material respects with its Documentation. If Licensee
provides Portal with written notice during the Warranty Period that the Licensed
Software fails to operate as warranted in this Section 12.1, Portal will use
reasonable efforts to cure the defect and make the Licensed Software operate as
herein warranted. Licensee's sole remedy in the event of breach by Portal of
this Section 12.1 shall be (i) replacement of the defective Licensed Software
program or defective portion thereof or (ii) termination of the license for the
nonconforming Licensed Software product and refund of the license fees paid
therefor. Portal shall have no obligations under this Section 12.1 to the extent
noncompliance results from (a) modification of the Licensed Software not
authorized by Portal, or (b) use of the Licensed Software for a purpose or in a
manner other than that for which it was designed. This Section 12.1 states
Portal's entire liability and Licensee's exclusive remedy with respect to any
breach by Portal of this Section 12.1.

12.2  Portal warrants that any services (including without limitation TAM,
training, implementation workshop or Support Services) performed under this
Agreement will be performed in a professional workmanlike manner consistent with
industry practices.

13  WARRANTY DISCLAIMER
EXCEPT AS EXPLICITLY SET FORTH IN SECTIONS 11 AND 12 ABOVE, PORTAL AND ITS
LICENSORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY REGARDING
OR RELATING TO THE LICENSED SOFTWARE OR THE DOCUMENTATION, OR ANY MATERIALS OR
SERVICES FURNISHED OR PROVIDED TO LICENSEE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. SPECIFICALLY,
PORTAL DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE LICENSED SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR FREE OR WILL
PERFORM IN AN UNINTERRUPTED MANNER. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, PORTAL
SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY,
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE (EVEN IF PORTAL HAD BEEN
INFORMED OF SUCH PURPOSE) WITH RESPECT TO THE LICENSED SOFTWARE, DOCUMENTATION
AND SERVICES AND WITH RESPECT TO THE USE OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING.

14  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
14.1  IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF
REVENUES OR PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER
IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT OR TORT, EVEN IF THE OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. EACH PARTY AGREES TO TAKE REASONABLE ACTION TO
MITIGATE ITS DAMAGES. LICENSEE AGREES TO REGULARLY BACK UP ITS DATABASE(S) IN
ACCORDANCE WITH REASONABLE INDUSTRY PRACTICES.

14.2  EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF A BREACH OF SECTION 4 (LICENSE RESTRICTIONS), 11
(INFRINGEMENT INDEMNITY) OR 17 (CONFIDENTIALITY) NEITHER PARTY'S OR ITS
LICENSORS' LIABILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES SHALL EXCEED AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE TOTAL
FEES PAID AND OWED TO PORTAL UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

15  AUDIT RIGHTS/QUARTERLY REPORTS
15.1  Licensee shall keep and maintain full, accurate and detailed records
regarding its payment obligations, the licenses granted under this Agreement and
the number and types of Subscribers in the Licensed Software Database and/or the
number of CDRs processed. Portal may, at its expense, no more than once per
year, and on thirty (30) days prior written notice, audit Licensee's use of the
Licensed Software and compliance with this Agreement. Any such audits shall
occur during normal business hours and shall not unreasonably interfere with
Licensee's business operations. If any such audit reveals a deficiency in any
amounts due to Portal hereunder, Licensee will be invoiced for such underpaid
fees based on the Price List in effect at the time the audit is completed. If
the underpaid fees exceed five percent (5%) of the license fees paid, then
Licensee shall also pay Portal's reasonable costs of conducting the audit.
Audits shall be conducted no more than once annually.

by the Licensed Software, (ii) a statement of any additional license and Support
Services fees owed to Portal and a reasonable summary of how such amounts were
calculated, and (iii) the then-current addresses of all locations where the
Licensed Software is installed. Within thirty (30) days following the end of
each calendar quarter the License Compliance Reports shall be sent to Portal
care of (or such other address as Portal may designate in writing):

otherwise transferred by Licensee (by operation of law or otherwise), in whole
or in part, including by way of merger, acquisition or sale of all or
substantially all of the assets in one or more related transactions, without
Portal's prior written consent.

17  CONFIDENTIALITY
Each Party acknowledges that the Confidential Information constitutes valuable
trade secrets and each party agrees that it shall use the Confidential
Information of the other party solely in accordance with the provisions of this

confidentiality of the terms and conditions disclosed thereto. Each party agrees
to exercise due care in protecting the Confidential Information from
unauthorized use and disclosure.  However, neither party bears any
responsibility for safeguarding any information that it can document in writing
(a) is in the public domain through no fault of its own, (b) was properly known
to it, without restriction, prior to disclosure by disclosing party, (c) was
properly

Page 3 of 10

disclosed to it, without restriction, by another person with the legal
authority to do so, (d) is independently developed by receiving party without
use of or reference to disclosing party's Confidential Information or (e) is
required to be disclosed pursuant to a judicial or legislative order or
proceeding; provided that, to the extent permitted by and practical under the
circumstances, receiving party provides to disclosing party prior notice of the
intended disclosure and an opportunity to respond or object to the disclosure or
if prior notice is not permitted or practical under the circumstances, prompt
notice of such disclosure. In the event of actual or threatened breach of the
provisions of Section 4 or Section 17, the non-breaching party will be entitled
to seek immediate injunctive and other equitable relief, without waiving any
other rights or remedies available to it.

by law must be in writing and must be (a) delivered in person, (b) sent by
registered mail, return receipt requested, (c) sent by overnight air courier, or

19  MISCELLANEOUS
19.1  Neither party will incur any liability to the other on account of any loss
or damage resulting from any delay or failure to perform all or any part of this

occurrences, or causes beyond its control and without negligence of the parties.
Such events, occurrences or causes will include, without limitation, acts of
God, strikes, lockouts, riots, acts of war, earthquakes, fire and explosions,
but the ability to meet financial obligations is expressly excluded.

19.2  Any waiver of the provisions of this Agreement or of a party's rights or
remedies under this Agreement must be in writing to be effective.  Failure,
neglect or delay by a party to enforce the provisions of this Agreement or its
rights or remedies at any time will not be construed to be deemed a waiver of
such party's rights under this Agreement and will not in any way affect the
validity of the whole or any part of this Agreement or prejudice such party's
right to take subsequent action.

19.3  If any term, condition or provision in this Agreement is found to be
invalid, unlawful or unenforceable to any extent, the parties shall endeavor in
good faith to agree to such amendments that will preserve, as far as possible,
the intentions expressed in this Agreement. If the parties fail to agree on such
an amendment, such invalid term, condition or provision will be severed from the
remaining terms, conditions and provisions, which will continue to be valid and
enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.

19.4  This Agreement (including the Schedules and any addenda hereto signed by
both parties) contains the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all previous communications,
representations, understandings and agreements, either oral or written, between
the parties with respect to said subject matter. No employee, agent,
representative or affiliate of Portal has authority to bind Portal to any oral
representations or warranty concerning the Licensed Software. Any written
representation or warranty not expressly contained in this Agreement is
unenforceable.

19.5  No terms, provisions or conditions of any purchase order, acknowledgement
or other business form that Licensee may use in connection with the acquisition
or licensing of the Licensed Software will have any effect on the rights, duties
or obligations of the parties under, or otherwise modify, this Agreement,
regardless of any failure of Portal to object to such terms, provisions, or
conditions.

19.6  The parties agree to reasonably cooperate in joint marketing  and public
relations activities including without limitation the issuance of a joint press
release announcing Licensee's selection of the Portal solution and participation
in Portal's Success Stories program. Licensee's public relations personnel will
have an opportunity to review and approve the final draft of any joint public
relations materials before distribution to the press. Following successful
implementation of the Licensed Software and at Portal's request, Portal shall be
permitted to conduct a brief telephone interview (not to exceed thirty minutes
without Licensee's consent)  with a senior-level spokesperson within Licensee's
organization involved with the implementation of the Portal solution. Portal may
write and publish a high-level success story profile based on the interview and
discussing the reasons supporting Licensee's choice of the Portal solution and
the benefits realized by Licensee. Licensee shall have final approval over the
final content of such literature prior to initial distribution by Portal. Except
as provided in this Agreement, neither party will engage in joint public
relations activities without the prior written consent of the other party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

19.7  Licensee agrees to be a reference account for Portal and will, at Portal's
request, participate in at least four (4) telephone reference inquiries per year
and at least one (1) onsite visit per year provided that Portal shall give
Licensee reasonable advance notice of not less than (i) 48 hours in the case of
a telephone reference visit and (ii) 7 days in the case of an onsite visit.
Further, Portal shall be permitted to identify Licensee as a customer so long as
such use does not imply endorsement.

19.8  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which so executed
will be deemed to be an original and such counterparts together will constitute
one and the same Agreement.

19.9  Portal is an independent contractor; nothing in this Agreement shall be
construed to create a partnership, joint venture or agency relationship between
the parties.

19.10  If this license is acquired under a U. S. Government contract, use,
duplication or disclosure by the U. S. Government is subject to restrictions set
forth in FAR subparagraphs 52.227-19(a)-(d) for civilian agency contracts and
DFARS 252.227-7013(c)(ii) for Department of Defense contracts. Portal reserves
all unpublished rights under United States copyright laws.

19.11  In the event that this Agreement or the licenses granted hereunder should
ever become subject to US bankruptcy proceedings, all rights and licenses
granted under or pursuant to this Agreement by Portal to Licensee are, and shall
otherwise be deemed to be, licenses of rights to ""intellectual property"" as
defined in Section 365(n) of the Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. Section 101 et.
seq.).  The parties agree that Licensee, as a licensee of such rights, shall
retain and may fully exercise all of the rights and election under Section
365(n) of the Bankruptcy Code.  The parties further agree that, in the event
that any proceeding shall be instituted by or against Portal seeking to
adjudicate it  bankrupt, or insolvent, or seeking liquidation, winding up,
reorganization, insolvency or reorganization, or relief of debtors, or seeking
an entry of an order of relief, or the appointment of a receiver, trustee or
other similar official for it or any substantial part of its property or it
shall take any action to authorize any of the foregoing actions,  Licensee shall
have the right to retain and enforce its rights under this Agreement as provided
under Section 365(n) of the Bankruptcy Code, including but not limited to, the
right to continue to use the Licensed Software in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

19.12  This Agreement will be interpreted and construed pursuant to the laws of
the State of California and the United States without regard to conflict of laws
provisions thereof, and without regard to the United Nations Convention on the
International Sale of Goods. Any legal action or proceeding relating to this
Agreement shall be instituted in a state or federal court in Santa Clara County,
California. Portal and Licensee agree to submit to the jurisdiction of, and
agree that venue is proper in, these courts in any such action or proceeding.

19.13  The prevailing party in any action to enforce this Agreement will be
entitled to recover its reasonable attorney's fees and costs in connection with
such action.

19.14   The provisions of this Agreement allocate the risks between Portal and
Licensee. Licensee's pricing reflects this allocation of risk and the limitation
of liability specified in this Agreement.

19.15  The parties have requested that this Agreement and all documents
contemplated hereby be drawn up in English.

or Attachments of this Agreement.

All purchase  orders shall  contain the  information  reasonably  necessary  for
Lucent to fulfill the order.  Lucent  promptly will notify Licensee if Lucent is
unable to FULFILL a purchase order as submitted.

The Parties  recognize  that from time to time  Licensee  may desire that Lucent
provide  Services  promptly and without adhering to the ordering process set out
by the above paragraphs,  for example,  in the case of a telephonic  request for
emergency  support.  Licensee shall promptly establish a ""running order"" against
which invoices for Services performed in response to such requests can be billed
at a  reasonable  cost to be  approved  by  Licensee  (such  approval  not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) and will be paid for by Licensee.

While it is Lucent's  objective to provide  Licensee with an  acknowledgment  of
each order  received,  it is Licensee's  responsibility  to advise Lucent of any
missing or late  notifications  to insure  that the order has not been lost.  No
order is to be  considered  ""accepted""  by Lucent  unless its  receipt  has been
acknowledged (such  acknowledgement not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
however,  orders for  Services  to be billed  against a running  order  shall be
deemed accepted by Lucent if Lucent commences performance thereof.


7.      DELIVERY

Lucent will make arrangements for the delivery of Licensed  Materials ordered by
Licensee  according to the Specifications and intervals included in Appendix B -
Statement  of Work.  Licensee  will  specify  the  location  for the order to be
delivered. Delivery will be made according to the standard procedures of Lucent,
unless otherwise requested by Licensee and agreed to by Lucent in writing.


7.1     SPECIAL PACKING AND/OR MARKING

Lucent's  prices include  packing and marking  containers in accordance
with Lucent's standard  practices for shipment.  When, in order to meet
Licensee's  written request,  Lucent packs a product and/or is required
to  mark  shipping  cartons  in  accordance  with  Licensee's   written
specifications,  such shall be done by Lucent for an additional  charge
which shall be invoiced to and paid by Licensee in accordance  with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement; provided that such charges have
been agreed upon by the Parties in writing.

Lucent shall:

destination,  weights and cubes.  International shipments will
also be marked with the freight-forward  location and the port
of destination.


7.2     PASSING OF RISK AND TITLE

Title to  Licensed  Materials  shall  not pass to  Licensee,  but shall
remain  with  Lucent  or its  suppliers,  as the case may be.  Title to
hardware will pass upon delivery to Licensee's  facility.  Risk of loss
or damage to Licensed  Materials,  including any media  containing  the
Licensed  Materials,  or other items  furnished to Licensee  under this
Agreement  shall  pass to  Licensee  upon  delivery  of  said  Licensed
Materials or items to an authorized  shipping agent or upon  completion
of transmission if electronically delivered.

Nothing herein shall, during the period a Party has the risk of loss or
damage to an item,  relieve the other Party of responsibility  for loss
or  damage to the item  resulting  from the acts or  omissions  of such
other Party, its employees or agents.


8.     ACCEPTANCE

After Lucent's  installation of the Licensed  Materials,  or any part thereof as
set forth in Appendix B, Lucent will deliver a Completion Notice to Licensee and

non-compliance   with  the  Specifications   within  [REDACTED]  after  Lucent's

and Licensee's receipt of the Completion Notice to inspect,  test, evaluate said
modified Licensed Materials to determine whether the modified Licensed Materials
are materially  compliant with the  Specifications.  Modified Licensed Materials
will be considered fully accepted unless Lucent receives written notification to
the  contrary   documenting  the  specific  material   non-compliance  with  the
Specifications  within  [REDACTED]  days  after  Lucent's  installation  of such
modified  Licensed  Materials and Licensee's  receipt of the Completion  Notice.
This process  shall be repeated  until the  Licensed  Materials  are  considered
accepted per this section.

Notwithstanding  anything in this  Agreement to the contrary,  Licensee's Use of
any part of the Licensed  Materials for any purpose  other than testing,  or any
other Use  conducted at Lucent's  direction or under  Lucent's  supervision,  as
provided  for above or  training,  whether or not  revenue is  generated,  shall
constitute Acceptance for all relevant purposes of this Agreement, including but
not limited to, commencement of the applicable warranty period.

The costs and expenses of the  Acceptance Tests will be borne by Licensee.  Upon
request of Licensee,  Lucent will provide  reasonable support to Licensee during
the Acceptance Tests.

9.    INVOICES AND TERMS OF PAYMENT

Lucent will forward invoices in Lucent's  standard format or as otherwise agreed
in writing by the Parties to Licensee upon shipment of the Licensed Materials or
portion  thereof.  Lucent will forward  invoices for Services upon completion of
the Services or portion  thereof  described in the invoice or as soon thereafter
as  practicable.  Licensee will pay said invoices as set out below.  If Licensee
requires  special  information on the invoice or that it be in a special format,
then Licensee shall pay Lucent for additional  charges associated with complying
with Licensee's special needs provided that the charges have been agreed upon by
the Parties in writing.

Licensee  shall pay each invoice for Licensed  Materials or Third Party Products
within  [REDACTED]  days from the date of the invoice.  Licensee  shall pay each
invoice for Services  within the later of (i)  [REDACTED]  days from the date of
the  invoice  or  (ii)  [REDACTED]  business  days  from  acceptance  or  deemed
acceptance by Licensee of that portion of the work or the Licensed  Materials to
which the Services  relate.  Such invoice shall not be subject to withholding or
reduction  for any  reason,  except as  provided  for in this  clause.  All bank
charges,  taxes,  levies  and other  costs  which  may be due or  become  due on
transfers of payments shall be for the account of Licensee.

If Licensee disputes any item contained on the invoice,  then Licensee shall pay
all undisputed  amounts to Lucent and notify Lucent of the disputed items within
the [REDACTED]  days of receipt of the invoice.  Upon resolution of the disputed
amount, which shall occur within [REDACTED] days, Licensee shall pay in full all
amounts due to Lucent.  If  Licensee  is unable to document a claim  against the
invoiced item, the original  invoice date plus [REDACTED] days will be the basis
for calculating late payment penalties set forth below.  Delinquent payments and
disputed payments where the dispute is resolved in favor of Lucent,  are subject
to a late  payment  charge  equal to the  lesser of (i)  [REDACTED]  or (ii) the
maximum amount allowed by law.

If an undisputed  invoice  remains unpaid for  [REDACTED]  days after payment is
due,  Licensee shall be in default of its obligations  under the Agreement,  and
Lucent may terminate this Agreement;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that Lucent will have
provided  [REDACTED]  Days prior written  notice to Licensee,  and Licensee will
have failed to pay all monies due,  including late payment charges by the end of
such  [REDACTED]  Day  period.  If Lucent  elects to  terminate  this  Agreement
pursuant to this paragraph, Lucent may, without prejudice to any other rights or
remedies of Lucent in this  Agreement  or at law or in equity  suspend all work,
and Licensee  shall  return to Lucent (or destroy in  accordance  with  Lucent's
written  instructions)  such  portion  of  Lucent's  products  and all copies of
Licensed  Materials  at all Licensee  locations  for which  payment  (including,
without limitation, license fees) has not been received. Licensee shall bear the
expense  of removal of  Lucent's  products  and  Licensed  Materials.  All costs
associated  with restoring  Licensee's  premises to  pre-installation  condition
shall be the sole responsibility of Licensee.  Licensee shall pay all documented
damages,  costs and expenses  (including,  without limitation,  reasonable legal
fees) incurred by Lucent in termination of this Agreement.


10.    TAXES & LEVIES

Licensee shall be liable for and shall reimburse  Lucent for all taxes,  duties,
levies and related  charges  (including  any  interest and  penalties),  however
designated (excluding taxes on Lucent's net income) imposed upon or arising from
the provision of Services,  or the transfer,  sale,  license, or use of Licensed
Materials  or other items  provided  by Lucent.  Taxes  reimbursable  under this
clause shall be separately listed on the invoice.


11
<PAGE>


Lucent shall not collect the otherwise  applicable tax if Licensee's purchase is
exempt  from  Lucent's  collection  of  such  tax  and  a  valid  tax  exemption
certificate is furnished by Licensee to Lucent.

Lucent  reserves  the right to claim  United  States  or  foreign  customs  duty
drawback  on all  sales  pursuant  to this  Agreement.  The  Parties  agrees  to
cooperate  with each other in this  regard in all  reasonable  ways,  including,
without   limitation,   providing  proof  of  exportation,   advance  notice  of
exportation, certificates,  endorsements, or any other documentation or proof as
may be necessary for Lucent or its Affiliates to receive payment of the drawback
claims and, if required by the United States Customs  Service or similar entity,
by making the  Licensed  Materials  available  for  examination  by such Customs
Service or entity.


11.    EXPORT CONTROL

The Parties  acknowledge that any License Materials and Information  (including,
but not limited to, Services and training)  provided under this Agreement may be
subject to U.S.  export  laws and  regulations,  and any use or transfer of such
Licensed  Materials and Information must be authorized under those  regulations.
Licensee  agrees not to use,  distribute,  transfer,  or transmit  the  Licensed
Materials or Information (even if incorporated into other products) in violation
of U.S. export  regulations.  If reasonably  requested by Lucent,  Licensee also
agrees to sign written assurances and other  export-related  documents as may be
required for Lucent to comply with U.S.
export regulations.


12.    APPLICABLE LICENSES

Upon delivery of Licensed Materials  pursuant to this Agreement,  and subject to
Licensee's  payment of the applicable  fees and  compliance  with the applicable
terms and conditions hereunder, Lucent grants to Licensee a perpetual, personal,
nontransferable,  and nonexclusive  license with use limitations to Use Licensed
Materials on the Designated Processors for its own business operations. Licensee
is  authorized  to Use  Licensed  Materials  within  a  capacity  limitation  to
interface with such network  elements at such capacity levels within  Licensee's
network as set forth in the  Statement  of Work.  Licensee  must pay  additional
license fees prior to exceeding the authorized  capacity  limitation.  Except as
provided  in the  following  paragraph,  no license is  granted to  Licensee  to
sublicense  such  Licensed  Materials  furnished by Lucent.  Licensee  shall not
reverse engineer,  decompile or disassemble Software furnished as object code to
generate  corresponding  Source  Code.  Unless  otherwise  agreed in  writing by
Lucent,  Licensee  shall not modify  Software  furnished  by  Lucent  under this
Agreement  except as provided in the Related  Documentation.  If the  Designated
Processor becomes temporarily inoperative,  Licensee shall have the right to Use
the Licensed  Materials  temporarily on a backup processor until operable status
is restored and processing on the backup processor is completed.


12
<PAGE>


Lucent  grants  to  Licensee  a  non-exclusive  and  non-transferable  right  to
sublicense  the Licensed  Materials  to a  wholly-owned  Subsidiary  on a single
Designated Processor; provided, however, as follows:

(i)      Such  Subsidiary  is  bound  in  writing  by the  same  terms,
conditions and  restrictions  as contained in this  Agreement,
but shall have no right to grant future sublicenses.

(ii)     Licensee shall remain fully liable for the  performance by the
Subsidiary of all terms of the sublicense.

(iii)    Licensee  shall use best  efforts to enforce  Lucent's  rights
under such  sublicense  agreement and shall do such things and
provide  Lucent with such  assistance  as may be necessary for
Lucent to enforce such rights.


12.1     TITLE, RESTRICTIONS AND CONFIDENTIALITY OF LICENSED MATERIALS

All Licensed Materials  (whether or not part of Firmware)  furnished by
Lucent,   and  all  copies   thereof   made  by   Licensee,   including
translations,  compilations,  and partial copies are, and shall remain,
the property of Lucent.  Except for any part of such Licensed Materials
which is or  becomes  generally  known to the public  through  acts not
attributable to Licensee,  Licensee shall hold such Licensed  Materials
in confidence,  and shall not,  without Lucent's prior written consent,
disclose,  provide,  or otherwise make available,  in whole or in part,
any Licensed  Materials  to anyone,  except to its  employees  having a
need-to-know in connection  with licensed Use.  Licensee shall not make
any copies of any  Licensed  Materials  except as necessary to exercise
the rights granted hereunder.  Licensee shall reproduce and include any
Lucent copyright and proprietary notice on all such necessary copies of
Licensed Materials.  Licensee shall also mark all media containing such
copies  with  a  warning  that   Licensed   Materials  are  subject  to
restrictions  contained in an agreement between Lucent and Licensee and
that they are the property of Lucent.  Licensee shall maintain  records
of the number and  location  of all copies of  Licensed  Materials.  If
Licensee's  license is canceled  or  terminated,  or when the  Licensed
Materials are no longer  needed by Licensee in  Licensee's  discretion,
Licensee  shall return all copies of such Licensed  Materials to Lucent
or follow written disposition instructions provided by Lucent.


12.2 MODIFICATIONS TO USER CONTROLLED MODULES

Licensee may add to,  delete from, or modify user  controlled  Software
modules or menus as  contemplated  in the Related  Documentation.  Such
changes or modifications,  however extensive, shall not affect Lucent's
title to the Licensed  Materials.  Licensee  shall retain  ownership to
intellectual property independently developed by Licensee. Lucent shall
have no  liability  for  Licensee's  errors in making  such  changes or
modifications.


12.3 CHANGES IN LICENSED MATERIALS

Prior to shipment,  Lucent at its option may, upon prior written notice
to  Licensee  and with  Licensee's  prior  written  consent,  not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, modify the Specifications relating to


13
<PAGE>


its Licensed  Materials,  provided the modifications,  under normal and
proper Use, do not materially  adversely affect the Use,  function,  or
performance of the ordered Licensed Materials.  Unless otherwise agreed
in  writing,  such  substitution  shall not  result  in any  additional
charges to  Licensee  with  respect to  licenses  for which  Lucent has
quoted fees to Licensee.


12.4 OPTIONAL SOFTWARE FEATURES

Software provided to Licensee under this Agreement may contain optional
features which are separately licensed and priced. Licensee agrees that
such  optional  features  will not  knowingly  be activated by Licensee
without  written  authorization  from Lucent and Licensee's  payment of
appropriate  license fees. If such features are activated  knowingly by
Licensee,  Licensee  agrees to so  notify  Lucent  promptly  and to pay
Lucent the  license  fees for the  activated  features,  as well as the
reasonable  cost of money for the  period in which such  features  were
activated.  In the  event  that such  features  are  activated  without
Licensee's  knowledge  in spite of  Licensee's  reasonable  efforts  to
comply with this restriction,  Licensee agrees to cooperate with Lucent
to  deactivate  such  features and prevent  future  activation  of such
features.


12.5 RELOCATION OF LICENSED MATERIALS

Upon [REDACTED] days advance written notice, Licensee may move Software
contained in the Licensed  Materials or optional  feature  packages for
which  Licensee has the right to Use,  from a Designated  Processor and
relocate them to another  Designated  Processor within the same company
as  Licensee.  Unless  otherwise  agreed  by the  parties  in  writing,
Licensee shall not be required to pay additional right-to-use fees as a
result of such  relocation,  except  where size  sensitive  units are a
factor or where use of the  Software  is for a different  purpose  than
originally specified. Lucent may charge Licensee for Services requested
by Licensee in support of such  relocation.  Licensee  shall remove all
copies of the Software from any  processor  from which the Software has
been  relocated.  To the extent that Lucent  otherwise  consents to the
relocation  of a Designated  Processor  outside of the United States or
the United  Kingdom,  Lucent and  Licensee  agree to  negotiate in good
faith an amendment to the geographic territories covered by Section 15.
The Parties acknowledge that such an amendment, if agreed, may increase
costs to Licensee.


12.6 CANCELLATION OF LICENSE

Notwithstanding any other clause in this Agreement to the contrary,  if
Licensee  materially  breaches any of the terms and  conditions of this
Agreement with respect to the unauthorized  Use, transfer or sublicense
of Licensed  Materials,  and such  failure  continues beyond [REDACTED]
days after receipt of written notice thereof by Licensee,  Lucent, upon
written  notice to  Licensee,  may, in  addition to any other  remedies
hereunder,  cancel the license  granted  hereunder  for the  applicable
portion of the Licensed  Materials  affected by the  unauthorized  Use,
transfer  or  sublicense.  Cancellation  of license  shall not  relieve
Licensee of its  obligation  to pay all the fees that have  accrued for
Use of the Licensed Materials.

13.      WARRANTY

13.1       [REDACTED]

13.2     YEAR 2000 WARRANTY

(a)      Lucent   represents   and  warrants  that  during  the  period
beginning  on the  warranty  start  date and for the  Warranty


15
<PAGE>


Periods set forth in this  Agreement,  but in no event  ending
prior to December 31, 2001, the Licensed  Materials  delivered
by Lucent to Licensee under this Contract will:

(i)      record,  store,  present and process  calendar  dates
falling  on or  after  January  1,  2000 in the  same
manner  and  with  the  same  functionality  as  such
products record,  store, present and process calendar
dates   failing  on  or  before   December  31,  1999
(including,  without  limitation,  the recognition of
the Year 2000 as a leap year); and

(ii)     provide the same  functionality  with  respect to the
introduction of records  containing  dates falling on
or after January 1, 2000, as it provides with respect
to  the  introduction  of  records  containing  dates
falling on or before  December 31,  1999.  All of the
foregoing  functionality shall be known as ""Year 2000
Capable.""

(b)      Year  2000  CapableLicensed  Materials  that are  intended  to
interoperate  as  described  in the  Statement of Work will be
compatible  and  interoperate  in such  manner  as to  process
between them, as  applicable,  date related data  correctly as
described in Section (a) above.

(c)      The foregoing  sets forth an additional  warranty for Lucent's
products and Software.  The failure of the Licensed  Materials
to meet the foregoing  requirements during the warranty period
set forth in this  subsection  13.2  entitles  Licensee to the
remedies set forth elsewhere in this Section 13.

(d)      Other  than as set forth in  Section  13.2(b),  nothing in the
foregoing  shall be deemed to make Lucent  responsible for the
Year   2000   capability   of   any   third   party   Software
interoperating  or  intending  to  operate  with the  Licensed
Materials.


13.3     NO ADDITIONAL WARRANTIES

THE  FOREGOING  WARRANTIES  ARE  EXCLUSIVE AND ARE IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER
EXPRESS AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES
OF  MERCHANTABILITY  AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR  PURPOSE.  LICENSEE'S
SOLE AND  EXCLUSIVE  REMEDY  SHALL BE  LUCENT'S  OBLIGATION  TO REPAIR,
REPLACE,  CREDIT, OR REFUND AS SET FORTH ABOVE.  LICENSEE'S SOLE REMEDY
FOR  INFRINGEMENT   SHALL  BE  THE  REMEDIES  SET  FORTH  IN  ""PATENTS,
TRADEMARKS & COPYRIGHTS"" HEREIN.


13.4 POST-WARRANTY SUPPORT

Post-warranty  support  will be  provided on terms and  conditions  and
subject to such fees as contained in a separate  maintenance  agreement
attached hereto


14.     USE OF INFORMATION

All technical and business  information in whatever form which bears a legend or
notice  restricting  its use,  copying or  dissemination  or, if not in tangible


16
<PAGE>


form,  is  described  as  being  proprietary  or  confidential  at the  time  of
disclosure and is subsequently  summarized in writing so marked and delivered to
the receiving Party within thirty (30) days of disclosure to the receiving Party
(all  hereinafter  designated  ""Information"")  shall  remain the property of the
furnishing  Party. All Software shall be deemed to be Information  regardless of
how labeled.  The furnishing  Party grants the receiving  Party the right to use
such Information only as follows:  Such Information (a) shall not be  reproduced
or copied, in whole or part, except for use as authorized in this Agreement; and
(b) shall,  together  with any full or partial  copies  thereof,  be returned or
destroyed when no longer needed. Licensee shall use such Information only (a) to
order, (b) to evaluate the Licensed Materials,  or other items, or Services,  or
(c) to install,  operate,  and maintain the particular  Licensed  Materials,  or
other items for which it was originally  furnished.  Unless the furnishing Party
consents in writing,  such  Information,  except for that part, if any, which is
known to the receiving Party to be free of any confidential obligation, or which
becomes  generally  known to the public  through  acts not  attributable  to the
receiving  Party,  shall  be held in  confidence  by the  receiving  Party.  The
receiving  Party  may  disclose  such  Information  to other  persons,  upon the
furnishing Party's prior written authorization,  but solely to enable such third
party to perform acts which this clause expressly authorizes the receiving Party
to perform  itself and further  provided  such other person agrees in writing (a
copy of which writing will be provided to the  furnishing  Party at its request)
to the same  conditions  respecting use of Information  contained in this clause
and to any other reasonable conditions requested by the furnishing Party.


15.     PATENTS, TRADEMARKS & COPYRIGHTS

In the event of any claim,  action,  proceeding or suit by a third party against
Licensee alleging an infringement of any United States or United Kingdom patent,
copyright,  or trademark,  or a violation in the United States or United Kingdom
of any trade secret or  proprietary  rights by reason of the use, in  accordance
with Lucent's or other applicable specifications,  any of the Licensed Materials
or other item furnished by Lucent to Licensee under this Agreement,  Lucent,  at
its expense,  will defend  Licensee,  subject to the  conditions  and exceptions
stated  below.  Lucent will  reimburse  Licensee  for any  losses,  liabilities,
claims,  actions,  cost, expense or attorney's fee, incurred at Lucent's written
request or  authorization,  and will  indemnify  Licensee  against any liability
assessed against  Licensee by final judgment on account of such  infringement or
violation arising out of such use.

If Licensee's use shall be enjoined or in Lucent's  reasonable opinion is likely
to be  enjoined,  Lucent  will,  at its expense  and at its  option,  either (a)
replace the affected  portion of the Licensed  Materials or other item furnished
pursuant to this Agreement with a suitable  substitute free of any  infringement
or  violation,  (b)  modify  it so that it will be free of the  infringement  or
violation,  or (c) procure  for  Licensee a license or other right to use it. If
none of the foregoing  options is  practical,  Lucent will give Licensee as much
notice  as  possible  and then  remove  the  enjoined  portion  of the  Licensed
Materials  or other  item,  or in the event  that  removal  of a portion  is not
commercially reasonable, such greater portion of the Licensed Materials or items
that is  commercially  reasonable,  and refund to Licensee a PRO RATA portion of
the license right to use fees paid to Lucent under this  Agreement  equal to the
remaining  useful  life of the  Licensed  Materials,  which  useful life will be
deemed to be ten (10) years from the date of delivery of the Licensed Materials.

Licensee shall give Lucent prompt  written  notice of all such claims,  actions,
proceedings  or suits alleging  infringement  or violation and Lucent shall have
full and  complete  authority  to assume  the sole  defense  thereof,  including
appeals,  and to settle  same.  Licensee  shall,  upon  Lucent's  request and at
Lucent's expense, furnish  all necessary information and assistance available to
Licensee and cooperate in every  reasonable way to facilitate the defense and/or


17
<PAGE>


settlement of any such claim, action, proceeding or suit at Lucent's expense. If
Lucent  fails or refuses to provide  the defense of Licensee as required by this
Section 15,  Licensee  shall be entitled to proceed  with its own defense at the
expense  of  Lucent.  Lucent  shall be  entitled  to  proceed  with a defense of
Licensee with a reservation of rights.

No  undertaking  of Lucent under this  section  shall extend to any such alleged
infringement  or violation  to the extent that it: (a) arises from  adherence to
design modifications,  specifications, drawings, or express written instructions
which  Lucent is  expressly  directed by  Licensee  to follow,  but only if such
alleged  infringement or violation does not reside in  corresponding  commercial
Licensed Material of Lucent's design or selection;  or (b) arises from adherence
to  instructions  to apply  Licensee's  trademark,  trade name, or other company
identification;  or (c) resides in a Licensed  Material which is not of Lucent's
origin  and  which is  furnished  by  Licensee  to  Lucent  for use  under  this
Agreement;  or (d) relates to use of Licensed  Materials or other items provided
by Lucent in  combinations  with other  products,  Licensed  Materials  or other
items,  furnished  either  by  Lucent  or  others,  which  combination  was  not
installed, recommended or otherwise approved by Lucent.

THE  LIABILITY  OF LUCENT  AND  LICENSEE  WITH  RESPECT  TO ANY AND ALL  CLAIMS,
ACTIONS,  PROCEEDINGS,  OR SUITS  BY  THIRD  PARTIES  ALLEGING  INFRINGEMENT  OF
PATENTS,  TRADEMARKS, OR COPYRIGHTS OR VIOLATION OF TRADE SECRETS OR PROPRIETARY
RIGHTS BECAUSE OF, OR IN CONNECTION  WITH, ANY ITEMS FURNISHED  PURSUANT TO THIS
AGREEMENT  SHALL BE  LIMITED TO THE  SPECIFIC  UNDERTAKINGS  CONTAINED  IN  THIS
SECTION.

16.      LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY

[REDACTED]

18
<PAGE>


17.     FORCE MAJEURE

Neither Party shall be liable to the other Party for any loss, damage,  delay or
failure of performance  resulting directly or indirectly from any cause which is
beyond its  reasonable  control,  including,  but not  limited to the  elements;
extraordinary  traffic conditions;  riots; civil  disturbances;  wars; states of
belligerency  or  acts  of the  public  enemy;  labor  disputes;  strikes;  work
stoppages;   inability  to  secure  raw  materials,  product  or  transportation
facilities; or the laws, regulations, acts or failure to act of any governmental
authority,  including  but not  limited  to  denial  of a U.S.  Export  License,
hereinafter  referred to as ""Force  Majeure"".  A Party shall promptly notify the
other Party of the  occurrence of a Force Majeure event and the notifying  Party
shall be excused from any further  performance of these obligations  affected by
the Force Majeure  Event for as long as such Force  Majeure Event  continues and
such Party uses and continues to use its best efforts to recommence performance.
Failure of a Party to perform under this Agreement because of the endurance of a
Force Majeure event for more than thirty (30) days will represent grounds by the
other Party to  terminate  the portion of this  Agreement  affected by the Force
Majeure event.


18.      INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR

All work  performed by one Party under this  Agreement  shall be performed as an
independent  contractor and not as an agent of the other and neither Party shall
be, nor represent itself to be, the employee, agent, representative,  partner or
joint  venture of the other.  Neither Party shall have the right or authority to
assume or create  an  obligation  on behalf of or in the name of the other or to
otherwise act on behalf of the other.  The performing Party shall be responsible
for its employees' and agents'  compliance with all applicable laws,  rules, and
regulations while performing work under this Agreement.


19.     ASSIGNMENT

Except as provided in this Agreement,  neither Party shall assign this Agreement
or any  right  or  interest  under  this  Agreement,  nor  delegate  any work or


19
<PAGE>


obligation to be performed under this Agreement,  (an ""assignment"")  without the
other Party's prior written consent.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  Lucent may
assign or delegate any portion of this  Agreement that relates to work performed
in the European Union to an affiliate  entity  domiciled in the European  Union;
provided,  however,  that Lucent shall remain responsible for the performance by
the assignee of such obligations.  Nothing shall preclude a Party from employing
a  subcontractor  in carrying out its obligations  under this  Agreement,  but a
Party's  use of  such  subcontractor  shall  not  release  the  Party  from  its
obligations under this Agreement.

20.     NON-WAIVER

No waiver of the terms and  conditions  of this  Agreement,  or the  failure  of
either Party to strictly  enforce any term or condition of this Agreement on one
or more  occasions  shall be  construed  as a waiver of the same or of any other
term or condition of this Agreement on any other occasion.


21.     SEVERABILITY

If any provision in this Agreement, or any portion thereof, is subsequently held
to be invalid or unenforceable under any applicable statute or rule of law, then
that provision or portion  notwithstanding,  this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and such  provision or portion shall be deemed omitted and this
Agreement  shall be construed as if such invalid or  unenforceable  provision or
portion had not been contained herein.

22.     SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES

Senior  Management of either Party may, upon notice of a dispute and within five
(5)  business  days of receipt of such a notice  from the other  Party  elect to
utilize a non-binding resolution procedure whereby each presents its case before
a panel consisting of two senior  executives of each of the Parties and, if such
executives  can agree upon such an  individual,  a mutually  acceptable  neutral
advisor.  If a Party elects to use the procedure  set forth in this clause,  the
other Party shall participate.  The hearing shall occur no more than 10 business
days after a Party serves  notice to use the procedure set forth in this clause.
If the matter cannot be resolved by such senior executives, the neutral advisor,
if one has been agreed upon,  may be asked to assist such senior  executives  in
evaluating the strengths and  weaknesses of each Party's  position on the merits
of their dispute. The Parties shall each bear their respective costs incurred in
connection  with the procedure set forth in this clause,  except that they shall
share equally the fees and expenses of the neutral advisor, if any, and the cost
of the facility for the hearing.

If a dispute is not  resolved as set forth above,  then either  Party may,  upon
notice  to the other  Party,  submit  the  dispute  to  binding  arbitration  in
accordance with the following:

(a)      The arbitration  shall be held in New York City before a panel
of three  arbitrators.  Either  Party may,  upon notice to the
other Party,  demand arbitration by serving on the other Party
a statement of the dispute,  the facts relating or giving rise
to such dispute and the name of the arbitrator selected by it.
Issues of arbitration shall be decided by the arbitrators.

(b)      Within five (5) days after  receipt of such notice,  the other
Party shall name its arbitrator, and the two arbitrators named
by the Parties shall,  within five (5) days  after the date of
such notice, select the third arbitrator.

(c)      The   arbitration   shall  be  administered  by  the  American
Arbitration  Association  and be  governed  by the  Commercial


20
<PAGE>


Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association,  as
may be amended from time to time, except as expressly provided
in this clause. The arbitrators may not amend or disregard any
provision of this clause.

(d)      Discovery shall only be allowed as ordered by the arbitrators.
The  arbitrators  shall allow such discovery as is appropriate
to the purposes of arbitration in accomplishing a fair, speedy
and  cost-effective  resolution of disputes.  The  arbitrators
shall  reference the rules of evidence of the Federal Rules of
Civil  Procedure  then in  effect  in  setting  the  scope and
direction  of such  discovery,  but shall  afford  substantial

23.      TERMINATION; SURVIVAL OF OBLIGATIONS

In the event that either Party is in material  breach or default of the terms of
this Agreement and such breach or default  continues for a period of thirty (30)
days after receipt of written notice from the other Party, then the Party not in
breach or default shall have the right to terminate this  Agreement  without any
charge , obligation or liability except for (i) charges to Licensee for Software
Products  already  delivered and accepted or deemed accepted and (ii) charges to
Licensee for Services already performed.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  if the
non-breaching party is Licensee,  Licensee may, at its option and in addition to
the remedies provided in Section 8A , return all Software Products to Lucent and
receive a refund from  Lucent for the amounts  paid to Lucent in clauses (i) and
(ii) above. The Party not in breach or default shall provide full cooperation to
the other party in every  reasonable  way to facilitate the remedy of the breach
or default  hereunder  within the applicable  cure period.  Notwithstanding  the
foregoing,  if the nature of the  material  breach or default is such that it is
not a  payment  obligation  (other  than  failure  to  comply  with the  license
restrictions  contained herein) and it is incapable of cure within the foregoing
thirty (30) day period, then the thirty (30) day cure period may be extended for
a  reasonable  period of time (in no event to exceed an  additional  thirty (30)
days), provided that the Party in breach or default is proceeding diligently and
in good faith to effectuate a cure.

The Parties  agree,  in good faith to negotiate  and  finalize  the  maintenance
agreement  (the  ""Maintenance  Agreement""),  as  referred  to in the letter from
Lucent dated  October 21, 1998,  within a period of fifteen (15)  business  days
following the Effective  Date.  The  Maintenance  Agreement will be based on the
pricing and other  principles as stated in the above referred to letter.  In the
event no  agreement  is  reached  within  said  time  frame  with  respect  to a
maintenance agreement, either party will have the right to immediately terminate
this Agreement with no additional obligations.

The Parties'  rights and  obligations  which,  by their nature,  would  continue
beyond the termination, cancellation, or expiration of this Agreement, including


21

but not  limited to, the  obligations  in the clauses  entitled  Limitations  of
Liability,  Patents, Trademarks and Copyrights, Use of Information,  Publication
of Agreement, and Export Control, shall survive such termination,  cancellation,
or expiration.


24.     GOVERNING LAW

Except as required by local law in any jurisdiction outside of the United States
and as expressly  agreed to in writing by the Parties,  this  Agreement  and the
rights and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement shall be construed in
accordance  with and be  governed  by the laws of the State of New York  without
giving effect to the principles therein relating to the conflicts of law.

Dear Frank,

This letter refers to our discussions of last Friday  (98/10/16) with respect to
changes to the scope of work of our project,  and is intended to synchronize our
presently negotiated SOW (Version 3.0 DRAFT 3) to the total price of the project
and the license agreement we are currently negotiating.  Secondly, we also refer
to the  discussions of last Friday  regarding  VIATEL's  request for maintenance
services. Thirdly, we would like to bring up a subject not previously discussed,
which is a recent  change to the number of switches in your  described  network,
that is now  included  in the  above  referenced  SOW and for which you have not
approved pricing.

Definition of 'no-breakage' support:
No-breakage support means:
a)       During the term of this maintenance agreement Lucent agrees to maintain
the compatibility  between the Software on the one hand, and the NORTEL
DMS systems  100E,  250/300,  and GSP on the other hand,  provided that
VIATEL  has  made   available  to  Lucent  well  in  advance  all  such
information (which may include Proprietary Information), subject to the
use and  disclosure  restrictions  of  this  Agreement,  as  reasonably
required to establish such compatibility.
b)       If VIATEL determines,  upon analysis  undertaken,  that there have been
any changes to its NORTEL DMS systems 100E, 250, 300, and GSP installed
in its network that would  affect the  compatibility  or the  operating
ability with Lucent's product or successor  product,  then VIATEL shall
promptly  provide to Lucent  the  information  necessary  for Lucent to
update the compatibility of its products or successor products.
c)       Compatibility  as  referred  to in sub a) and  sub b)  means  that  the
functionality  of  Lucent  products  will  not  be  affected.  However,
compatibility does not mean, and Lucent does not warrant,  that the new
functionality  of the new  generic  release of the NORTEL DMS  software
will work in conjunction with and is supported by the Lucent product.

[REDACTED]

Please provide us with written confirmation on acceptance of this letter.

Sincerely

Angela R. Pinette

instrument  duly  executed  by or on behalf of each  party  hereto.  A waiver by

provided for in this Agreement shall be cumulative and in addition to and not in
lieu of any  other  remedies  available  to  either  party at law,  in equity or

future be developing technology  internally,  or receiving technology from third
parties that may be similar to technology  developed by Licensee with the use of
or  access  to  ATI  Confidential  Information.  Accordingly,  nothing  in  this

use Residuals for any purpose,  including without limitation use in development,
manufacture,  promotion,  sale and  maintenance  of its products  and  services;

f)   ""NEC Services"" means remote network management services, incorporating
or using the Licensed Products, provided by NEC to customers.

2.   Term:

This Agreement shall commence on the date above and shall continue in force
for a term of three (3) years unless terminated earlier under the
provisions of this Agreement. Subject to the provisions of Section 9
herein, at the end of the initial term, this Agreement shall extend
automatically for additional one (1) year periods without notice unless
thirty (30) days prior to the and of the term or extended period, either
party notifies the other that this Agreement will not be extended for an

3.   Grant of Rights to NEC:

a)   Licensed Products:  On or before February 16, 2001, the parties will
agree to standards for the Licensed Products and include said
standards on Schedule A (the ""Standards""). As soon as practical
thereafter, NetSolve shall deliver to NEC the Licensed Products,
within thirty (30) days after NEC's receipt of the Licensed Products
from NetSolve, NEC will inspect the Licensed Products for conformity
with the Standards. NEC shall notify NetSolve in writing within such
thirty (30) day period (subject to extension by force majeure) as to
whether the licensed Products conform to such Standards. If the
Licensed Products conform to such Standards, NEC may use the Licensed
Products pursuant to Section 3b) below and the other provisions of
this Agreement. If the Licensed Products do not conform to such
Standards, NEC must identify specific defects that cause the Licensed
Products not to meet the Standards. If NEC does not provide written
notice of specific defects within said thirty (30) day period, the
initial U.S. $* installment of the License Fee shall not be refundable
to NEC, NetSolve shall have thirty (30) days (subject to extension by
force majeure) from its receipt of written notice of such defects to
cure the defects. If NetSolve timely offers a cure for the defects,
NEC will again inspect the Licensed Products for conformity with the
Standards within thirty (30) days. If the Licensed Products conform to
such Standards, NEC may use the Licensed Products pursuant to Section
3b) below and the other provisions of this Agreement. If the Licensed
Products, as modified, do not conform to such Standards, this
Agreement shall terminate immediately upon NEC's written notice of
nonconformity and NEC shall have no right to use the Licensed Products
in any manner and shall immediately return the Licensed Products to
NetSolve. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if NetSolve is unable to cure
the defects identified by NEC in accordance herewith, NetSolve shall
refund the U.S. $* installment of the License Fee to NEC. If NEC does
not accept the Licensed Products due to problems within NEC's control,
the U.S. $* initial installment of the License Fee shall be non-
refundable to NEC. If the defects are attributable to causes outside
the control of either party, then U.S. $* of the initial installment
of the License Fee shall be refunded to NEC.

b)   Grant of License:  NetSolve hereby grants NEC an exclusive and non-
transferable right to use the Licensed Products in object code form
solely for the purpose of rendering NEC Services to Customers and for
the management of NEC and its subsidiaries' own network (the
""Permitted Use""). In addition, NEC may make a copy of software
included within the Licensed Products for enhancing NEC Services for
capacity, performance, and redundancy reasons and for archival
purposes, and of documentation included within the Licensed Products
to the extent reasonably necessary for exercising the rights granted
under this Section 3b) In addition, NEC have the right to translate
NetSolve copyrighted documentation from English to Japanese.
Notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary, NEC shall not
use the Licensed Products for, or make available services involving
the Licensed Products to, any entity that does not qualify as a
Customer as defined above. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent
NetSolve from granting rights in the Licensed Products to other
parties for any other purpose, including the provision of network
management services to entities which are not Customers but, so long
as NEC keeps exclusivity under c) below, NetSolve is prohibited to
license the Licensed Products for Permitted Use to Customers in Japan.
The exclusive nature of NEC's rights granted hereunder with respect to
the Permitted Use shall be subject to Section c) below. NEC is
expressly prohibited from decompiling, disassembling, or reverse
engineering the Licensed Products in any manner whatsoever, and NEC is
expressly prohibited from designing another product or system,
including, without limitation, a

<PAGE>

competing product, that is based upon, any of the Licensed Products;
provided, however, that NEC may continue to provide its existing
network management service in its current form.

c)   Exclusive Right:  In order to maintain the exclusive nature of the
right to use the Licensed Products for the Permitted Use as described
in Section b) above, NEC must pay NetSolve minimum annual payments in
each of the years during the three year period described below of
US$*, US$* and US$*, respectively(the ""Exclusivity Amounts""). For this
purpose, the first year shall begin upon the earlier of completion of
the installation of NEC's Network Operation Center in Japan or June
30, 2001, unless delay of installation of the NEC Network Operations
Center is due to NetSolve's fault, in which case the Initiation Date
shall be extended to the extent of the delay caused by NetSolve. The
Exclusivity Amounts shall be comprised of the One Time License Fee
(amortized over a 36 month life commencing with the Initiation Date),
Royalty Fees, and Maintenance Fees due to NetSolve under this
Agreement as described on Schedule B attached hereto and made a part
hereof for all purposes by NEC. In the event NEC has not incurred the
Exclusivity Amounts in any year, NEC shall have the right to either
(i) pay the differences between the actual amounts incurred and the
applicable Exclusivity Amount within thirty (30) days after the end of
the applicable year period, or (ii) lose its exclusive right described
in Section 3b) above while retaining its license rights as set forth
herein to render NEC services to Customers on a non-exclusive basis.

d)   Governmental Approvals: Notwithstanding anything herein seemingly to
the contrary, this Agreement, the license granted herein and the
delivery of the Licensed Products are conditioned on the attainment of
any required governmental approvals relating to the importation or
exportation of the Licensed Products.

a)   License Fees and Charges:  NEC agrees to pay the License Fee, Royalty
Fees and Maintenance Fees (collectively, the ""Fees"") as set forth in

NetSolve's Fees shall not be effective until ninety (90) days after
notification by NetSolve to NEC. Any such increase shall apply only to
devices or services using the Licensed Products which are ordered
after the date of NetSolve's notice of Fee increase. In the event of a
Royalty and/or Maintenance Fee decrease, all devices or services using
the Licensed Products which had been ordered but not implemented as of
the date of NetSolve's notice of Fee decrease will be adjusted to take
into consideration the fee decrease. NetSolve agrees to consider, in
good faith, adjustments to the Fees in the event that the Fees at any
point in time do not agree with market conditions.

b)   Minimum Fees During Term.  NEC agrees that, during the initial three
(3) year term of this Agreement, it shall pay NetSolve minimum Fees of
US $* (""Minimum Term Fee""). If, upon the completion of the initial
three (3) year term of this Agreement, or upon the earlier termination
of this Agreement for any reason (other than NEC not accepting the
Licensed Products pursuant to the provisions of, and the procedure set
forth in, Section 3a) above or if NEC terminates the agreement
pursuant to Section 9d), the aggregate Fees actually paid by NEC to
NetSolve hereunder is less than the Minimum Term Fee, NEC shall
promptly pay NetSolve the difference between the aggregate Fees
actually paid and the Minimum Term Fee.

c)   Taxes and Charges: The Fees for the Licensed Products do not include
any taxes except income or withholding tax, duties or any other
charges of any kind that may be applicable to the purchase or
transportation, importation or exportation of the Licensed Products.
In the event the Japanese Government imposes any income or withholding
tax on NetSolve and requires NEC to withhold such tax from the payment
of the Fees, NEC shall notify NetSolve in sufficient time in advance
of such withholding to allow NetSolve to fully exercise any and all
appeal rights with respect to the assessment of such tax and
withholding. If, after such appeal NEC is required to withhold from
the payments hereunder, or if NetSolve chooses not to appeal such tax
and withholding, NEC may withhold from the said payment in accordance
with legal requirements. NEC shall provide NetSolve a tax receipt
received from such tax authority and shall assist NetSolve in claiming
and receiving a foreign tax credit. All

that it will provide NEC sufficient time not to exceed 24 months to
transition the NEC Services to another provider and minimize any negative
impact on NEC's Customer base:

a)   Termination for Cause:  If either party materially defaults in the
performance of any provision of this Agreement, then the non-
defaulting party may give written notice to the defaulting party that
if the default is not cured within thirty (30) days from the date of
such notice the Agreement will be terminated. If the non-defaulting
party gives such notice and the default is not cured during such
thirty (30) day period, then the non-defaulting party may terminate
the Agreement at the end of that period.

b)   Termination for Insolvency:  This Agreement may be terminated,
immediately upon: (i) the institution by or against either party to

its business, transfer of 50.1% or more of its outstanding stock, or
merger to, by or with, as the case may be, a business entity that
provides products and services in direct competition with the
terminating party's products or services, and in the terminating
party's sole judgment continuing the relationship with the surviving
entity would create a conflict of interest (each, a ""Change of
Control""). Such termination must be given by written notice provided
within thirty (30) days of being notified by the party with the Change
of Control. In addition, NEC may terminate this Agreement in the event
NEC determines, in its sole discretion, to discontinue its business
relating to the Licensed Products within 1 year after the execution of

be waived provided NEC terminates this Agreement on the first (1st)
anniversary of the acceptance of the Licensed Products due to NEC's
termination of its NEC Services business; (ii) any unpaid portion of
the License Fee (unless the termination is the result of NEC not
accepting the Licensed Products in accordance with the provisions of,
and the procedure set forth in, Section 3a)); (iii) all Royalty Fees

effecting such termination), cease all use of the Licensed Products
and return the Licensed Products to NetSolve at NEC's sole cost and
expense. NEC shall not retain any portion of the Licensed Products or
any copies thereof. In the event that, following the termination of
this Agreement, NEC discovers that it possesses any portion of the
Licensed Products or any copies thereof, NEC will promptly return it
to NetSolve at NEC's sole cost and expense. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if NetSolve should terminate this Agreement for any reason
other than NEC's default or insolvency, NEC shall be entitled to (i)
maintain for existing Customers for a period of three (3) years as of
the termination date, and (ii) to sell to now Customers for a period

party, nor disclose to any third party, any Confidential Information

protect the confidentiality of such Confidential Information. All
information disclosed by one party to the other party hereunder which
the disclosing party intends to be treated as Confidential Information
shall be clearly marked. The parties acknowledge and agree that the

constitute the valuable Confidential Information of NetSolve. Upon
request by either party, the other party shall advise whether or not
it considers any particular information or materials to be
confidential. In the event of termination of this Agreement for any
reason, there shall be no use or disclosure by a party of any
Confidential Information of the other party for a period of five (5)

aggrieved party shall be entitled to any remedies available to it at
law or in equity, including, without limitation, the right to
temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief and specific

attorneys' fees, costs and damages awarded against or incurred by Greate Bay in
such actions which are attributable to such claim provided that Greate Bay

the Software, the SMS, the Source Code and all other information supplied by
ACSC in connection with this Agreement, including but not limited to any know-
how or expertise, (collectively, the ""Confidential Information""), will be deemed
confidential/proprietary information of ACSC.  Greate Bay agrees that it shall
maintain the Confidential Information under secure conditions, using reasonable
security measures and in any event not less than the same security procedures

any Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written
consent of ACSC.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Greate Bay may make the
Software or the SMS Software available, without ACSC's prior express consent, to
any independent consultant or consulting group retained by Greate Bay solely for
purposes specifically related to Greate Bay's permitted use, operation and
application of the Software or the SMS, but only after such independent
consultant or consulting group has executed a written confidentiality agreement
pursuant to which it covenants to not use the Confidential Information except
for Greate Bay as permitted herein and to not

<PAGE>

disclose the Confidential Information under the same conditions of
confidentiality contained herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Greate Bay may
disclose appropriate portions of Confidential Information to those of its
personnel who have a need to know the specific information in question in
connection with Greate Bay's rights or the performance of obligations under this
Agreement. All such personnel will be instructed by Greate Bay that the
Confidential Information is subject to the obligation of confidentiality set
forth by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Greate Bay may disclose
Confidential Information to an entity that is not a competitor of ACSC and is
offering (i) a Plan of Reorganization in the Chapter 11 Proceeding or (ii) to
purchase control of Greate Bay, provided however, that any such entity shall
enter into a non-disclosure agreement that requires such entity to protect such
information in the same manner as is required by this Paragraph 10.

(c) Equitable Remedies.  The obligations of Greate Bay in this
Paragraph 10 shall be specifically enforceable and Greate Bay agrees that (i)
any breach of Greate Bay's obligations under this Paragraph 10 would cause
irreparable injury to ACSC; (ii) ACSC would have an inadequate remedy at law for
any such breach; (iii) the balance of interests and hardships would favor an
injunction in favor of ACSC; (iv) the public interest would favor an injunction
in favor of ACSC, and (v) Greate Bay will make no legal arguments that equitable
relief is not an appropriate remedy in favor of ACSC in the event of a breach of
Greate Bay's obligations under this Paragraph.

11.  EXCLUSION OF INCIDENTAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.  NEITHER PARTY WILL
BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY (NOR TO ANY PERSON CLAIMING RIGHTS DERIVED FROM THE
OTHER PARTY'S RIGHTS) FOR INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR
EXEMPLARY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, including lost profits or revenue, loss of
business, or other economic damage, and further including injury to property, AS
A RESULT OF BREACH OF ANY WARRANTY OR OTHER TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS
OF WHETHER THE PARTY LIABLE OR ALLEGEDLY LIABLE WAS ADVISED OR HAD OTHER REASON
TO KNOW OR IN FACT KNEW OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.  Independent of, severable
from, and to be enforced independently of any other enforceable or unenforceable
provision of this Agreement, IN NO EVENT SHALL ACSC's AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO
GREATE BAY (INCLUDING TO ANY PERSON OR PERSONS WHOSE CLAIM OR CLAIMS ARE BASED
ON OR DERIVED FROM A RIGHT OR RIGHT CLAIMED BY GREATE BAY), WITH RESPECT TO ANY
AND ALL CLAIMS AT ANY AND ALL TIMES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THE SUBJECT
MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT, IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED ONE MILLION
DOLLARS ($1,000,000.00).

breach of Greate Bay's obligations under this Agreement would cause irreparable
injury to ACSC; (ii) ACSC would have an inadequate remedy at law for any such
breach; (iii) the balance of interests and hardships would favor an injunction
in favor of ACSC; (iv) the public interest would favor an injunction in favor of
ACSC, and (v) Greate Bay will make no legal arguments that equitable relief is
not an appropriate remedy in favor of ACSC in the event of a breach of Greate
Bay's obligations under this Agreement.

13.  ASSIGNMENT.  Greate Bay may not assign any right under this Agreement
and any purported assignment will be null and void and a breach of this
Agreement.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a change of control of
Greate Bay shall not constitute an assignment, and Greate Bay shall have the
right to assign its rights under this Agreement to any person or entity
acquiring substantially all of the assets of Greate Bay or at least 51 percent
of the equity of Greate Bay through purchase, merger, or reorganization and any
such person shall in turn have the right to assign to any other person coming
within the exception provided in this sentence.  ACSC shall have the right to
assign its rights under this Agreement provided that any such assignee shall
expressly assume ACSC's obligations to Greate Bay pursuant to this Agreement and
that the assignment shall include sufficient Intellectual Property, personnel
and other know how such that ACSC can reasonably expect the Assignee to be able
to fulfill the obligations to Greate Bay under this Agreement.

party respectively has full right, power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and the person executing this Agreement on its behalf has actual

This application also performs as the primary information data bank of
information specific to individual patrons gaming activity and
profitability.  Information from both table and slot activity is combined
with the ability to view this information and either combined or
independently.  A complimentary decision process has been incorporated so
that improved customer service may result by removing the requirement for
executive decisions on all issuances.
<PAGE>

EXHIBIT ""D""

CASINO SALES AND MARKETING SYSTEM


ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT

This module provides the ""housekeeping"" functions required to maintain an
accurate data bank of patron information for marketing purposes.  It also
serves to reduce cost specifically for the direct mail marketing
application and purging of inactive patrons.

EXTRACT MANAGEMENT

This is a flexible and robust patron selection module used primarily to
target specific segments of patrons for various marketing and/or analysis
functions.  The results of these extracts may be directed towards numerous
forms of processing.

GROUPS/INVITATION SYSTEM

The primary purpose of the group system is to enable the analysis of
profitability, both actual and potential, for up to twenty (20) user
defined groups or event types.  Expenses and/or complementaries may be
charged direct to a patrons account or as a percentage of theoretical
across all players within the group.  Groups may also include Branch
Offices and Junket Representatives with the ability to compute commissions.
Historical analysis by group type or monthly rep performance is provided.
The invitation module enables the booking of patrons responses to specific
events (i.e. Head liner shows).  Blocking of an event enables analysis
based on invited segment(s).

SWEEPSTAKES SYSTEM

The sweepstakes system provided for the controlling and winner selection
electronically for various promotional sweepstakes.  Entries earned by
patrons are automatically recorded with randomized winner selection based
on event, date and time of day.  If required entries may require pre-
qualification.  Linkage to the direct mail provides for notification of
entries.
<PAGE>

EXHIBIT ""E""

TABLE MARKETING SYSTEM

TABLE MARKETING SYSTEM (TMS)
TMS was developed as an extension of the SMS for table games and utilizes
the same network and controller boards (with function keypads and mark
sense printers).  The primary purposes of TMS consist of: a) control of
complementaries at the table games; b) access to patron information for
ratings, credit and tracking of cash transactions; and c) time and
attendance for pit personnel.
<PAGE>

EXHIBIT ""F""

CASINO ANALYSIS
This system provides the analysis department with information on patrons
gaming history.  Data extraction options allow flexibility in selecting
patron segments for analysis, and an interface to the Group system allows
group analysis.  Data can be interpreted in report format, or downloaded to
a PC for analysis utilizing PC based software, i.e. Foxpro.  Selections
from PC analysis can also be uploaded to the AS/400 to drive the Sales &
Marketing extract system.

MIS RESOURCE REQUEST SYSTEM
The MIS Resource Request system allows the entry and tracking of requests
for maintenance and new requests for Software, Hardware, and other services
provided by MIS.  The system utilizes control files to allow flexibility in
establishing Application areas and allows tracking of the progress of a
request from initial request entry through completion.  For Software
revisions, the system incorporates source and object movement to control
the development/testing cycle and movement to a production environment.
Tracking and reporting of man hours by request is also available.

SECURITY INCIDENT REPORTING SYSTEM
This system provides for the entry of Security Incident data to allow
tracking and reporting of various types of incidents.  Incidents can be
tracked from initiation through closure, and some limited claim/settlement
tracking is provided.

CROSS SYSTEM BACKUP (CSB)
This application is used in a multiple CPU environment to provide a 'hot'
backup capability, for use in the event of a severe hardware failure.  CSB
utilizes the Journaling feature of the AS/400 to capture changes to
designated application system files on a CPU, and transmits the changes to
another CPU, where the CSB application on this CPU applies the changes to
the application files residing on that CPU.

automatically assigned by Licensee to Licensor upon any termination of this Agreement. Any End User License Agreement (as defined below) granted to a customer of any Affiliate Sublicensee pursuant to Section 2.3 herein shall survive any
termination of this Agreement and Licensor may, at its option, assume such End User License Agreement in the event that this Agreement terminates. Except for the right to enter into sublicenses with customers pursuant to Section 2.3 herein, no
Affiliate Sublicensee shall be permitted to sublicense to any other Person the rights granted to it with respect to the Licensed Works.

may, at its option, assume such End User License Agreement in the event that this Agreement terminates and (ii) cannot be assigned, sublicensed or otherwise transferred by the customer without the prior written consent of Licensee or its
Affiliate Sublicensee (as applicable), except in the event of the assignment or sale of all or substantially all of the customer’s assets, or any merger, consolidation or other business consolidation to which the customer is a party.

2.4. Existing Customers. Licensor acknowledges that as of the date of this Agreement, Licensee licenses the Misys Connect Software
to certain of its customers (“Existing Customers”) and agrees that Licensee may continue to license the Misys Connect Software to such Existing Customers under the terms and conditions of their current agreements; provided

confidential proprietary intellectual property of such other Party, without the prior consent of the other Party.
2.8. Conversion to
Open-Source License. Licensor may at any time license, or make available for license, any of the Licensed Works or any component thereof pursuant to any open-source license (such works, “Open-Sourced Works”); provided
that (i) Licensor provides Licensee with thirty (30) days advance notice of its intent to do so and (ii) the source code for any such Open-Sourced Works does not,



6









without Licensee’s prior consent thereto, disclose the proprietary intellectual property of Licensee in the data structures of the Meditech, MyWay or
Allscripts proprietary adapters; provided further that Licensor shall, promptly following the reasonable request of Licensee, discuss with Licensee any questions or concerns Licensee may have with respect to the disclosure of
the proprietary data structures of such proprietary adapters that are or may become Open-Sourced Works. At Licensee’s option, such Open-Sourced Works shall become subject to the Open Source Software License Agreement or another form of software

hereof.

3.05  REMOVAL OF  MARKINGS.  Licensee  agrees not to remove,  mutilate,  or
destroy any copyright, patent notice, trademark, service mark, other proprietary

ARTICLE 4. WARRANTY PROVISIONS

4.01 WARRANTIES

(a)  General.  Licensor  warrants  that (i) it has  good  title to the
Application  Software and the right to license its use to Licensee  free of
any proprietary rights, liens, or encumbrances of any other party, (ii) the
Application  Software  will  permit  the System to  provide  Services  when
properly interconnected to Licensee's functioning switches described in the
Marketing  Agreement  (provided,  that any  modification of the Application
Software by any persons other than Licensor shall void the Warranty in this
clause(ii)); and (iii) commencing on installation thereof, and for a period
of 90 days thereafter,  (x) the Software shall be free of viruses,  bugs or
contaminants  which may cause  damage to  Licensee's  systems or  interrupt
Licensee's utilization of a System; and (y) the media in which the Software
is contained shall be free of material defects in materials or workmanship.

(b)  Year  2000.  Licensor  warrants  that  the  Application  Software
delivered or modified by Licensor is, or will be, Year 2000  Compliant  (as
defined  below).   Year  2000  Compliant   software  that  is  intended  to
interoperate with third party products  (including Third Party Software) as
described herein will be compatible and  inter-operate in such manner as to
process  between  them,  as  applicable,  date  related  data  correctly as
described in the definition of ""Year 2000  Compliant.""  Except as set forth
in the preceding  sentence,  (i) Licensor  assumes no  responsibilities  or
obligations to cause third party products to function with the  Application
Software;  and (ii) Licensor will not be in breach of this warranty for any
failure  of the  Application  Software  to be Year 2000  Compliant  if such
failure results from the inability of any software, hardware, or systems of
Licensee  or  any  third  party  to be  Year  2000  Compliant.  ""Year  2000
Compliant"" means that (a) neither the performance nor  functionality of the
Application  Software  will be affected by dates prior to, during and after
the year 2000, (b) no value for current date will cause any interruption in
the operation of the Application Software;  (c) the year 2000 is recognized
as a leap year; (d) in all interfaces and data storage the century,  in any
date,  is specified  either  explicitly  or by  unambiguous  algorithms  or
inferencing  rules;  and (e) date-based  functionality  of the  Application
Software  behaves and will behave  consistently  for dates prior to, during
and after the year 2000.

4.02  REMEDIES.  In  the  event  of  any  nonconformity  or  defect  in the
Application  Software  (or any other  breach with  respect to the  condition  or
operation  of the  Application  Software)  for which  Licensor  is  responsible,
Licensor shall, during the foregoing  respective  warranty periods,  (A) provide
reasonable efforts to correct or cure such nonconformity, defect, contaminant or
breach (which may include a workaround for system errors), (B) at Licensor's


SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT - PAGE 3



<PAGE>



option,  replace the relevant part of the Application Software in lieu of curing
such nonconformity, defect, contaminant or breach, or (C) if Licensor determines
that neither of the foregoing is commercially practicable, remove the System and
terminate the Marketing Agreement and this License Agreement.

4.03 WARRANTY  DISCLAIMER.  LICENSOR DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT ALL
ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED.  LICENSEE  AGREES THAT  LICENSEE'S  SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE
REMEDY  FOR THE  DEFECTS  DESCRIBED  IN THIS  SECTION  SHALL BE  LIMITED  TO THE
CORRECTIVE ACTION DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION. THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN
THIS AGREEMENT ARE IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING
ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

4.04 LIMITATION OF REMEDIES.  LICENSEE AGREES THAT ITS EXCLUSIVE  REMEDIES,
AND LICENSOR'S  ENTIRE LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE IS AS SET FORTH IN
THIS  AGREEMENT.  LICENSEE  FURTHER  AGREES THAT LICENSOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO
LICENSEE FOR ANY INDIRECT DAMAGES,  INCLUDING ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS, OR
OTHER INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL  DAMAGES,  ARISING OUT OF ITS USE OR INABILITY
TO USE THE SOFTWARE OR THE BREACH OF ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY,  EXCEPT AS
SET FORTH IN SECTION 4.05.

4.05 INDEMNIFICATION.

(a)  Infringement.  Licensor agrees to indemnify and hold Licensee and
its directors, officers, employees and agents, harmless against any and all
claims, demands,  actions,  losses,  liabilities,  judgments,  settlements,
awards  and  costs  (including  reasonable  attorneys'  fees and  expenses)
(collectively,  ""Liabilities"")  arising  out of or  related  to  any  claim
against  Licensee by a third party that Licensee's use or possession of the
Application  Software (or the license  granted to Licensee  hereunder  with
respect thereto), infringes or violates any United States patent, copyright
or other proprietary right of any third party; provided that Licensee gives
Licensor  prompt notice of any such claim of which it has actual  knowledge
and cooperates  fully with Licensor in the defense of such claim.  Licensor
shall have the exclusive  right to defend and settle at its sole discretion
and expense all suits or proceedings arising out of the foregoing. Licensee
shall not have the right to settle any action,  claim or threatened  action
without the prior  written  consent of  Licensor  (at  Licensor's  sole and
absolute discretion).  In case use of the Application Software is forbidden
by a court of competent  jurisdiction because of proprietary  infringement,
Licensor shall promptly, at its option, (i) procure for Licensee the rights
to continue  using the  Application  Software;  (ii) replace the infringing
Application  Software  with  non-infringing  Application  Software of equal
performance  and quality which are materially the functional  equivalent of
the   infringing   Application   Software;   (iii)  modify  the  infringing
Application   Software  so  it  becomes   non-infringing  while  materially
maintaining the functionality thereof; or (iv) if none of the foregoing are
commercially  practicable,  remove the System and  terminate  the Marketing
Agreement  and this License  Agreement  Licensor will then be released from
any  further  obligation   whatsoever  to  Licensee  with  respect  to  the
infringing part of the Application Software.  Nothing in this Section shall
be deemed to make Licensor liable for any patent or copyright infringement


SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT - PAGE 4



<PAGE>



suits  that  arise in  connection  with (a)  designs,  modifications,  use,
integration or data furnished by Licensee if  infringement  would have been
avoided by not using or combining the Application  Software with such other
programs or data or (b) if infringement  would have been avoided by the use
of an updated version made available to Licensee.

(b) Other.  Licensor  agrees to indemnify and hold  Licensee  harmless
against any and all Liabilities arising out of Licensor's negligent acts or
omissions, intentional torts, or material breach of this Agreement.

amendment   to  this   Agreement   and  which  is  signed  by  duly   authorized
representative of the parties.

6.07 PARTIAL  INVALIDITY.  If any clause or provision of this  Agreement is
held to be  illegal,  invalid,  or  unenforceable  under  present or future laws
effective  during the term of this Agreement,  then and in that event, it is the
intention of the parties hereto that the remainder of this  Agreement  shall not
be  affected  thereby,  and it is also  the  intention  of the  parties  to this
Agreement  that in lieu of each clause or  provision of this  Agreement  that is
held to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable,  there be added as a part of this
Agreement a clause or provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid, or
unenforceable  clause or provision as may be possible and still be legal, valid,
and enforceable.

6.08 ATTORNEYS FEES. The prevailing party in any litigation, arbitration or
other proceedings arising out of this Agreement shall be reimbursed by the other
party  for all  costs  and  expenses  incurred  in such  proceedings,  including
reasonable attorneys' fees.

6.09 FORCE MAJEURE. No party hereto shall be liable for delay or default in
performing hereunder, other than a delay or default in payment of any monies due
to the other  party,  if such  performance  is delayed or  prevented  by a Force
Majeure Condition. ""Force Majeure Condition"" means any condition or event beyond
the reasonable control of the party affected thereby, including fire, explosion,
or other casualty, act of God, war or civil disturbance, acts of public enemies,

contractual  capacity,   labor  difficulties,   and  strikes,  but  specifically
excluding  a party's  failure  to be Year  2000  Compliant.  If a Force  Majeure
Condition  occurs,  the party  delayed  or unable to perform  shall give  prompt
notice of such  occurrence to the other party.  The party  affected by the other
party's  inability  to perform  may,  after  sixty  (60)  days,  elect to either
terminate  this Agreement or continue  performance  with the option of extending
the terms of the Agreement up to the length of time the Force Majeure  Condition
endures.  The party  experiencing  the Force Majeure  Condition  must inform the
other party in writing when such a condition ceases to exist.  Each party shall,
with the cooperation of the other,  exercise all reasonable  efforts to mitigate
the extent of a delay or failure resulting from a Force Majeure Condition.

6.10 INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. The relationship of the parties established by
this Agreement is that of independent contractors, and nothing contained in this
Agreement  will be  construed  (a) to give either  party the power to direct and
control the day-to-day activities of the other, (b) to constitute the parties as
partners,  joint  venturers,  owners or otherwise as  participants in a joint or
common  undertaking,  or (c) to allow  either  party to  create  or  assume  any
obligation on behalf of the other for any purpose whatsoever.

the following schedule:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
<S>                                                                    <C>

</TABLE>

3.2 In return for the licenses granted pursuant to Section 2.3 and

Handspring a license fee for the initial three years of the term of this
Agreement equal to $[***], of which (i) $[***] shall be due and payable on the
Acceptance Date, (ii) $[***] shall be due and payable on the first anniversary

In furtherance of the foregoing and in consideration of the performance
by Handspring of its obligations under Section 2.3, OmniSky agrees to pay
Handspring the annual maintenance fees for the Proxy Software set forth in the
following schedule:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
<S>                                                                    <C>
Acceptance Date (covering the first full year):               $[***]

not less than an aggregate of $[***] for marketing and related activities which

[***] Confidential treatment has been requested for the bracketed portions. The

<PAGE>   6
the second anniversary of the Effective Date and (iii) the remaining $[***] of
such Marketing Funds shall be expended by the third anniversary of the Effective
Date. The Marketing Funds will be used for marketing and other promotional
activities that have been approved in advance by both OmniSky and Handspring.
Such activities may include, but are not limited to, prominent mention of
Handspring in advertisements, subsidization of wireless modems for use with
Handspring devices and inclusion of Handspring products in OmniSky media events.
Before any amounts may be credited against OmniSky's marketing obligations,
OmniSky must submit a request to Handspring, together with a description of the
activities and a budget of the costs of the activities, for approval. Handspring
will use reasonable efforts to respond to each such request within ten (10) days
of receipt. OmniSky may credit against its marketing obligations hereunder any
activities approved by Handspring pursuant to this Section 3.3. If OmniSky
expends, or causes to be expended, an amount which exceeds the approved budgeted
amount, any amounts that exceed the approved budget by more than 10% shall not
be credited against OmniSky's marketing obligations unless and until such excess
amounts are approved by Handspring.

3.4 In return for Handspring licensing and providing to OmniSky the
Handspring Derivative Works, OmniSky shall reimburse Handspring, within 30 days
after receipt of invoice therefor, for all amounts payable by Handspring to its
licensors and other third-party suppliers that would not have been payable by
Handspring but for OmniSky's exercise of the licenses granted hereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at least thirty (30) days prior to any delivery
to OmniSky of a Handspring Derivative Work, Handspring shall notify OmniSky in
writing of the amount of the reimbursement obligation that would be incurred by
OmniSky as a result of such Handspring Derivative Work. If OmniSky notifies
Handspring in writing within ten (10) business days after receiving the
foregoing reimbursement notice that OmniSky wishes to exclude such Handspring
Derivative Work from the licenses granted hereunder, Handspring shall not
deliver to OmniSky such Handspring Derivative Work, and OmniSky shall not be
responsible for any reimbursement obligation with respect thereto.

3.5 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at anytime Handspring shall
license both the Client Software and the Proxy Software (excluding any hosting
of the Proxy Software by Handspring on an ASP-basis) to any Entity identified in
Exhibit C (a ""Third Party License"") in consideration for licensing, maintenance
or other fees which, in the aggregate and in light of any different terms of
such Third Party License, are less than the aggregate of the licensing,
maintenance and other fees (excluding the Marketing Funds) payable by OmniSky
hereunder, then the licensing, maintenance and other fees payable by OmniSky
hereunder shall automatically be reduced to an amount equal or, in light of any
different terms of such Third Party License, equivalent to the fees payable
under the Third Party License; provided that, under no circumstances shall
Handspring be required pursuant to this Section 3.5 to refund amounts previously
paid by OmniSky to Handspring under this Agreement. Handspring agrees to notify
OmniSky in writing within fourteen (14) days after its execution of any
agreement which triggers the fee reduction set forth in this Section 3.5.

[***] Confidential treatment has been requested for the bracketed portions. The
confidential redacted portion has been omitted and filed separately with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

ARTICLE 4

TECHNICAL SUPPORT

4.1 Handspring shall provide OmniSky with technical support of the
Proxy Software at the levels set forth on Exhibit D and for the period(s)
provided below. All technical support provided by Handspring will be performed
in a full and professional manner by qualified individuals. OmniSky shall pay
Handspring a total of $[***] in four equal installments of $[***] due in
advance, respectively, on the Acceptance Date and three, six and nine months
after the Effective Date, which shall entitle OmniSky to support through the
first anniversary of the Effective Date. Subject to OmniSky's continued payment
therefor, such support shall automatically renew for subsequent one-year terms
on the same terms unless OmniSky notifies Handspring, at least sixty (60) days
before the end of the then-current term, of its election not to renew. OmniSky
may terminate support at any time by written notice to Handspring; provided
that, if such termination occurs before the first anniversary of the Effective
Date, any unpaid balance of the $[***] fee for the initial year of such services
shall accelerate and be payable in full upon such termination. If such
termination occurs after the first anniversary of the Effective Date, OmniSky
shall not be responsible for any installment of the $[***] fee for the current
renewal term which has not yet become due pursuant to this Section 4.1. In
addition to the foregoing technical support, Handspring shall provide OmniSky,
at no additional charge, up to ten (10) hours per calendar quarter of technical
support regarding the use of the source code to the Client Software (in such
form as delivered hereunder by Handspring). OmniSky shall be solely responsible
for support of its Customers.

4.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at anytime hereafter Handspring
commences providing technical support in substantially the same manner as
described in Section 4.1 as part of its licensing terms for the Licensed
Software for fees that, in the aggregate and in light of any different terms of
such technical support, are less than the fees payable by OmniSky therefor, then
the fees payable by OmniSky shall automatically be reduced to an amount equal
or, in light of any such different terms, equivalent to such lower fees.

4.3 Without limiting the technical support provided in Section 4.1,
within thirty (30) days after the Effective Date, Handspring shall conduct a
one-day training program regarding the Licensed Software for up to an aggregate
of ten (10) OmniSky personnel. Such program will take place at a time and place
mutually agreed by the parties, and shall be conducted in such a manner as is
reasonably adequate to train OmniSky personnel in relevant aspects of the
Licensed Software, including without limitation, the server architecture and
operations, installation, configuration, troubleshooting, scaling and tuning.

for the period of one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of delivery to
Handspring of any OmniSky Derivative Work, Handspring shall be prohibited from
distributing such OmniSky Derivative Work to or using such OmniSky Derivative
Work on behalf of any other licensee of the Client Software without OmniSky's
prior written consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Handspring's rights in the
source code of OmniSky Derivative Works shall terminate upon expiration or
termination of this Agreement for any reason.

5.4 Subject to the terms of this Agreement, OmniSky hereby grants to
Handspring, under any rights exercisable by OmniSky now or hereafter in OmniSky

obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall be extinguished, except
that (a) if OmniSky terminates for convenience as provided above, all unpaid
installments of the Client Software license fee set forth in Section 3.1 shall
accelerate and be paid in full on or prior to such termination, provided that

claim in reliance on the limitation of liability under Article 12, (b) all other
accrued payment obligations hereunder shall survive such termination or
expiration, (c) the rights and obligations of the parties under Articles 5, 6,

SOFTWARE LICENSE AND SERVICES AGREEMENT

This Software License and Services Agreement (""Agreement"") is between Oracle
Corporation (""Oracle"") and the Customer identified below. The terms of this
Agreement shall apply to each Program license granted and to all services
provided by Oracle under this Agreement, which will be identified on one or
more Order Forms.

1.    DEFINITIONS

for which Customer is granted a license pursuant to this Agreement, and the
media, Documentation and Updates therefor.

1.2.  ""DOCUMENTATION"" means the user guides and manuals for installation and
use of the Program software. Documentation is provided in CD-ROM or bound form,
whichever is generally available.

1.3.  ""UPDATE"" means a subsequent release of the Program which Oracle generally
makes available for Program licenses at no additional license fee other than
media and handling charges, provided Customer has ordered Technical Support for
such licenses for the relevant time period. Update shall not include any
release, option or future product which Oracle licenses separately.

1.4.  ""ORDER FORM"" means the document in hard copy or electronic form by which
Customer orders Program licenses and services, and which is agreed to by the
parties. The Order Form shall reference the Effective Date of this Agreement.

designated on the relevant Order Form.

1.6.  ""TECHNICAL SUPPORT"" means Program support provided under Oracle's
policies in effect on the date Technical Support is ordered.

Oracle to Customer, or if no delivery is necessary, the Effective Date set
forth on the relevant Order Form.

II.   PROGRAM LICENSE

2.1.  RIGHTS GRANTED

A.    Oracle grants to Customer a nonexclusive license to use the
Programs specified on an Order Form under this Agreement, as
follows:

i.    to use the Programs solely for Customer's operations on the
Designated System or on a backup system if the Designated
System is inoperative, consistent with the use limitations
specified or referenced in this Agreement, an Order Form, or
the Documentation. Customer may not relicense, rent or lease
the Programs or use the Programs for third-party training,
commercial time-sharing or service bureau use;

ii.   to use the Documentation provided with the Programs in
support of Customer's authorized use of the Programs;

iii.  to copy the Programs for archival or backup purposes, and to
make a sufficient number of copies for the use specified in
the Order Form. All titles, trademarks, and copyright and
restricted rights notices shall be reproduced in such copies;

iv.   to modify the Programs and combine them with other software
products; and

v.    to allow third parties to use the Programs for Customer's
operations so long as Customer ensures that use of the
Programs is in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

Customer shall not copy or use the Programs (including the
Documentation) except as specified in this Agreement or an Order
Form. Customer shall have no right to use any other software
program that may be delivered with ordered Programs.

B.    Customer agrees not to cause or permit the reverse engineering,
disassembly or decompilation of the Programs, except to the extent
required to obtain interoperability with other independently
created software or as specified by law.

C.    Oracle shall retain all title, copyright and other proprietary
rights in the Programs. Customer does not acquire any rights,
express or implied, in the Programs, other than those specified in
this Agreement.

2.2.  TRANSFER AND ASSIGNMENT

A.    Customer may transfer a Program license within its organization
upon notice to Oracle; transfers are subject to the terms and fees
specified in Oracle's transfer policy in effect at the time of the
transfer.
<PAGE>   2
B.    Customer may not assign this Agreement or transfer a Program
License to a legal entity separate from Customer without the prior
written consent of Oracle. Oracle shall not unreasonably withhold
or delay such consent.

2.3.  VERIFICATION

At Oracle's written request, not more frequently than annually, Customer
shall furnish Oracle with a signed certification verifying that the
Programs are being used pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement and
applicable Order Forms.

Oracle may audit Customer's use of the Programs. Any such audit shall be
conducted during regular business hours at Customer's facilities and
shall not unreasonably interfere with Customer's business activities. If
an audit reveals that Customer has underpaid fees to Oracle, Customer
shall be invoiced for such underpaid fees. Audits shall be conducted no
more than once annually.

III.  TECHNICAL SERVICES

3.1.  TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES

Technical Support services ordered by Customer will be provided under
Oracle's Technical Support policies in effect on the date Technical
Support is ordered.

3.2.  CONSULTING AND TRAINING SERVICES

IV.   TERM AND TERMINATION

4.1.  TERM

If not otherwise specified on the Order Form, this Agreement and each
Program license granted under this Agreement shall continue perpetually
unless terminated under this Article IV.

4.2.  TERMINATION BY CUSTOMER

Customer may terminate any Program license at any time; however,
termination shall not relieve Customer's obligations specified in Section
4.4.

4.3.  TERMINATION BY ORACLE

Oracle may terminate this Agreement or any license upon written notice if
Customer materially breaches this Agreement and fails to correct the
breach within 30 days following written notice specifying the breach.

4.4.  EFFECT OF TERMINATION

Termination of this Agreement or any license shall not limit either party
from pursuing other remedies available to it, including injunctive
relief, nor shall such termination relieve Customer's obligation to pay
all fees that have accrued or are otherwise owed by Customer under any
Order Form. The parties' rights and obligations under Sections 2.1.B,
2.1.C, and 2.2.B, and Articles IV, V, VI and VII shall survive
termination of this Agreement. Upon termination, Customer shall cease
using, and shall return or destroy, all copies of the applicable Programs.

V.    INDEMNITY, WARRANTIES, REMEDIES

5.1.  INFRINGEMENT INDEMNITY

Oracle will defend and indemnify Customer against a claim that the Programs
infringe a copyright or patent or other intellectual property right,
provided that: (a) Customer notifies Oracle in writing within 30 days of
the claim; (b) Oracle has sole control of the defense and all related
settlement negotiations; and (c) Customer provides Oracle with the
assistance, information and authority necessary to perform Oracle's
obligations under this Section. Oracle will reimburse Customer's reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing such assistance. Oracle shall
have no liability for any claim of infringement based on use of a
superseded or altered release of Programs if the infringement would have
been avoided by the use of a current unaltered release of the Programs
which Oracle provides to Customer.

If the Programs are held or are believed by Oracle to infringe, Oracle
shall have the option, at its expense, to (a) modify the Programs to be
noninfringing; or (b) obtain for Customer a license to continue using the
Programs. If it is not commercially reasonable to perform either of the
above options, then Oracle may terminate the license for the infringing
Programs and refund the license fees paid for those Programs. This Section
5.1 states Oracle's entire liability and Customer's exclusive remedy for
infringement.

5.2.  WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIMERS

A.    Program Warranty

Oracle warrants for a period of one year from the Commencement Date
that each unmodified Program license will perform the functions
described in the Documentation.

B.    Media Warranty

Oracle warrants the tapes, diskettes or other media to be free of
defects in materials and workmanship under normal use for 90 days
from the Commencement Date.

C.    Services Warranty

Oracle warrants that its Technical Support, training and consulting
services will be performed consistent with generally accepted

<PAGE>   3
industry standards. This warranty shall be valid for 90 days from
performance of service.

D.   DISCLAIMERS

THE WARRANTIES ABOVE ARE EXCLUSIVE AND IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER
WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.

ORACLE DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE PROGRAMS WILL OPERATE IN
COMBINATIONS OTHER THAN AS SPECIFIED IN THE DOCUMENTATION OR THAT
THE OPERATION OF THE PROGRAMS WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR
ERROR-FREE. PRE-PRODUCTION RELEASES OF PROGRAMS AND
COMPUTER-BASED TRAINING PRODUCTS ARE DISTRIBUTED ""AS IS.""

5.3.      EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES

For any breach of the warranties contained in Section 5.2, Customer's
exclusive remedy, and Oracle's entire liability, shall be:

A.   For Programs

The correction of Program errors that cause breach of the
warranty, or if Oracle is unable to make the Program operate as
warranted, Customer shall be entitled to terminate the Program
license and recover the fees paid to Oracle for the Program
license.

B.   For Media

The replacement of defective media returned within 90 days of the
Commencement Date.

C.   For Services

The reperformance of the services, or if Oracle is unable to
perform the services as warranted, Customer shall be entitled to
recover the fees paid to Oracle for the unsatisfactory services.

VI.       PAYMENT PROVISIONS

6.1.      INVOICING AND PAYMENT

All fees shall be due and payable 30 days from the invoice date. Any
amounts payable by Customer hereunder which remain unpaid after the
due date shall be subject to a late charge equal to 1.5% per month
from the due date until such amount is paid. Customer agrees to pay
applicable media and shipping charges. Customer shall issue a purchase
order, or alternative document acceptable to Oracle, on or before the
Effective Date of the applicable Order Form.

6.2.      TAXES

The fees listed in this Agreement do not include taxes, if Oracle is
required to pay sales, use, property, value-added or other taxes
based on the licenses or services granted in this Agreement or on
Customer's use of Programs or services, then such taxes shall be
billed to and paid by Customer. This Section shall not apply to taxes
based on Oracle's income.

VII.      GENERAL TERMS

7.1.      NONDISCLOSURE

By virtue of this Agreement, the parties may have access to

years after termination of this Agreement. The parties agree, unless
required by law, not to make each other's Confidential Information

reasonable steps to ensure that Confidential Information is not
disclosed or distributed by its employees or agents in violation of

relevant Order Form (if to Customer) or to the Oracle address on the
Order Form (if to Oracle).

To expedite order processing, Customer agrees that Oracle may treat
documents faxed by Customer to Oracle as original documents;
nevertheless,




<PAGE>   4
either party may require the other to exchange original signed
documents.

7.5.      LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS,
REVENUE, DATA OR USE, INCURRED BY EITHER PARTY OR ANY THIRD PARTY,
WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT OR TORT, EVEN IF THE OTHER PARTY HAS
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. ORACLE'S LIABILITY
FOR DAMAGES HEREUNDER SHALL IN NO EVENT [**] AND IF SUCH DAMAGES
RESULT FROM CUSTOMER'S USE OF THE PROGRAM OR SERVICES, SUCH LIABILITY
SHALL BE LIMITED TO FEES PAID FOR THE RELEVANT PROGRAM OR SERVICES

and Customer. Oracle's pricing reflects this allocation of risk and
the limitation of liability specified herein.

unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain
in full force.

arising out of this Agreement may be brought by either party more
than two years after the cause of action has accrued.

representations, written or oral, concerning the subject matter of
this Agreement. This Agreement may not be modified or amended except
in a writing signed by a duly authorized representative of each
party; no other act, document, usage or custom shall be deemed to
amend or modify this Agreement.

It is expressly agreed that the terms of this Agreement and any Order
Form shall supersede the terms in any Customer purchase order or
other ordering document. This Agreement shall also supersede all
terms of any unsigned or ""shrinkwrap"" license included in any
package, media, or electronic version of Oracle-furnished software
and any such software shall be licensed under the terms of this
Agreement, provided that the use limitations contained in an unsigned
ordering document shall be effective for the specified licenses.

software  and  documentation   errors  that  are  brought  to  MENTAT's
attention.

(b) SHIM BUG  FIXES for  errors  that  cause  NetLOCK
Software to become essentially unusable. Such errors shall be corrected
within [*] calendar days after MENTAT receives notice of the error. All
other errors shall be corrected  within [*] calendar  days after MENTAT
receives  notice of the  error;  other than  those  errors  that do not
substantially  affect the  functionality of the NetLOCK Software or its
compliance  with the  Specifications,  which errors may be corrected in

require not more than two (2) person weeks of effort to modify the SHIM
to correctly  function on such operating  system  according to the SHIM
Specification.

*Confidential Treatment Requested


<PAGE>

In the event that  INTERLINK  purchases  Support for at least five (5) Platforms
per year, MENTAT shall make limited  enhancements such as functionality  changes

its  sublicensees to agree,  to distribute  Licensed SHIMs to third parties only
pursuant to an appropriate  end user  agreement,  such as the end user agreement
attached  hereto as Attachment C, and will take all reasonable  steps to protect

warrants that it has the right to grant the license  rights granted to INTERLINK
under this Agreement.  MENTAT  warrants that it will  incorporate no third party
components in the SHIMS created by MENTAT under this Agreement.  MENTAT warrants
that to the best of MENTAT's  knowledge  the Licensed  SHIMs do not infringe the
intellectual property rights of others in existence as of the Effective Date.

Section  8.2  INTERLINK  Representation.  Subject to (a) Closing of the
Asset Purchase  Agreement  between Hughes Aircraft  Company and INTERLINK as the
term  ""Closing""  is  defined  in that  agreement  and (b) the  execution  of the
Agreement  and Mutual  Release  between  MENTAT and Hughes  Information  Systems
Company,  INTERLINK  represents that it has acquired  Hughes Aircraft  Company's

licensed software with Licensed SHIMS and the claim for such infringement  would
have been avoided if such non-MENTAT licensed software had not been used.

hereafter defined in paragraph 6(d), and the supplier lists described in
Paragraph 6(e) and such other services as may now or hereafter be provided by

1997 by and between Logical Solutions International, Inc. and Caesars World,
Inc. (the ""Caesars Agreement"") without regard to quantity and volume discounts
and without discrimination as to Greate Bay,

<PAGE>

terms no less favorable than would be offered by or through ACSC to ACSC's most
favored customer and without discrimination as to Greate Bay.

(c) Provision of Materials and Updates.  Greate Bay may retain and,
upon the signing of this Agreement to the extent Greate Bay is not in
possession, ACSC shall provide Greate Bay with all basic materials,
documentation manuals in printed and magnetic format, source codes, including
but not limited to the source code for all systems and application programs
running on the AS/400 and in the ""HASS"" file servers, the ""Gearbox"" PC's, the
""Collector"" Logic Board, and any other processor utilized in the SMS and the
Software, and other documentation integral to the SMS Protocol or to the source
codes or otherwise delineating and explaining the structure, organization,
sequencing and operation of the source codes relating to the Software and the
SMS (collectively the ""Source Code"") that are in ACSC's possession or control
and for which ACSC has the legal right to provide copies to third parties.  All
Source Code will be provided in the highest form that allows modification.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Source Code for the Operating System of the
""Collector"" Logic Board shall be placed in Escrow as provided in Paragraph 7 of
this Agreement.  During the term of this Agreement, ACSC shall make available to
Greate Bay upon their completion copies of all modifications, improvements, or
updates (""Updates"") to the Software and/or the SMS at the same time or prior to
the date on which ACSC makes such updates available to other customers of ACSC,
and shall further provide Greate Bay no later than 10 days after request by
Greate Bay, with copies of the Source Code for such Updates and revised copies
of the Source Code for the entire Software and SMS which includes the Source
Code for such Updates.  Greate Bay shall have the right within the Licensed
Facilities or at other locations authorized under this Agreement to full and
unfettered use of the Source Code and may permanently install and maintain the
Source Code in its computer system for its own internal use.

(d) Provision of Hardware and Maintenance and Support Services.
During the term of this Agreement and as may be requested by Greate Bay from
time to time, ACSC shall provide Greate Bay, with SMS Hardware Components and
Support Services for Software and SMS. Support Services means providing Updates,
Required Additions and/or Changes (as defined below), providing Error
Corrections (as hereinafter defined) in the Software and/or SMS and/or in the
communication between the Software and/or SMS and other systems covered by this
Agreement or as may be mutually agreed upon the parties, providing telephone
support and providing programming and project management services and such other
services as may be required via telephone and at Licensed Facilities to install,
integrate, maintain and support the Software and SMS. The term Required
Additions and/or Changes means all changes and additions that must be made to
Software and/or SMS to keep it in compliance with statutory,

<PAGE>

regulatory, and accounting practices changes. The term Error Correction means a
modification, change or improvement to the Software or SMS that corrects an
Error (as defined below). The term Error means a defect, deficiency or other
problem with the Software or SMS that causes the Software or SMS to fail to
operate in accordance with the documentation for the Software or SMS, to produce
incorrect results, to damage data, to incorrectly store, retrieve, sort, present
or calculate data, or to have a commercially unacceptable response time (i.e.
time from input to producing a response). ACSC agrees that when Greate Bay
reports an Error, ACSC will immediately commence work on an Error Correction and
provide an Error Correction (i) as soon as reasonably possible if no
commercially acceptable workaround is available to Great Bay or (ii) within a
reasonable period of time if a commercially acceptable workaround is available
or (iii) with the next Update or release of the Software or SMS if the Error is
cosmetic or not material to the use of the Software or the SMS. ACSC agrees to
provide Required Additions and/or Changes no later than two weeks prior to the
effective date of such statutory, regulatory and/or accounting practices
changes.

(e) Provision of Supplier Lists.  Upon the signing of this Agreement,
ACSC shall provide Greate Bay with a list of SMS Hardware component suppliers
and shall, upon any addition or change to such supplier list, provide Greate Bay
with an updated list.  In consideration of being provided with a list of SMS
Hardware component suppliers, Greate Bay promises not to purchase SMS Hardware
components directly from such suppliers absent a default by ACSC of its
obligations under this Paragraph 6.

(f) Equitable Remedies.  The obligations of ACSC in this Paragraph 6
shall be specifically enforceable and ACSC agrees that (i) any breach of ACSC's
obligations under this Paragraph 6 would cause irreparable injury to Greate Bay;
(ii) Greate Bay would have an inadequate remedy at law for any such breach;
(iii) the balance of interests and hardships would favor an injunction in favor
of Greate Bay; (iv) the public interest would favor an injunction in favor of
Greate Bay, and (v) ACSC will make no legal arguments that equitable relief is
not an appropriate remedy in favor of Greate Bay in the event of a breach of
ACSC's obligations under this Paragraph.

7.   ESCROW OF THE ""COLLECTOR"" LOGIC BOARD SOURCE CODE.  The Escrow Agent

intellectual property right owned by any other persons.  Greate Bay acknowledges
and understands that Greate Bay must obtain licenses for the serial or other
protocols from the respective game manufacturers necessary to interface the
Software and the SMS with the games of each manufacturer.  ACSC will defend at
its expense or settle at its option, any action brought against Greate Bay to
the extent that it is based on a claim that the Software, the SMS Hardware or
the SMS Software or the Configuration, as used within the scope of this
Agreement, infringes any copyright or United States patent.  ACSC will pay any
attorneys' fees, costs and damages awarded against or incurred by Greate Bay in
such actions which are attributable to such claim provided that Greate Bay
notifies ACSC in writing of the claim within five (5) calendar days of the
service or other notification of such claim upon Greate Bay and ACSC fully
controls the defense and settlement of such claims.  Should the Software or the
SMS or the SMS Software or the Configuration become, or, in ACSC's opinion, be
likely to become the subject of a claim of infringement of a copyright or
patent, ACSC may procure for Greate Bay the right to continue using the
Software, the SMS or the SMS Software or the Configuration or replace or modify
the Software, the SMS or the SMS Software or the Configuration to make it non-
infringing, provided that no such replacement or modification shall decrease or
adversely change the performance of the Software or SMS or the Configuration and
further provided that no such replacement or modification shall cause Error.
ACSC shall have no liability for any claim of copyright or patent infringement
based on the use or combination of the Software, the SMS, SMS Software or the
Configuration with programs or data not supplied by ACSC.  Any indemnity
provided herein shall not exceed and shall expressly be limited to Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00).

OF

<PAGE>

derivative modifications or extensions at the Licensed Facilities, except as
provided in the next sentence.  With respect to the Electronic Drop feature of
the SMS (""EDrop""), ACSC will submit the EDropcode for approval, provided the
applicable gaming authority has authorized implementation of EDrop on a
conceptual basis either by established policy or published regulation.  If
approval of EDrop has been so authorized by the applicable gaming authority,
ACSC will conform the logic of the EDrop code to any applicable and generally
applied specifications of the gaming authority.  Greate Bay agrees that it is
solely responsible for all testing and internal control compliance with respect
to the SMS, including, but not limited to, security of the computer system

reasonable assistance requested of it by Greate Bay with respect to testing and
internal control compliance.

10.  CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY INFORMATION.

(a) Confidential/Propriety Information.  The parties acknowledge that
the Software, the SMS, the Source Code and all other information supplied by
ACSC in connection with this Agreement, including but not limited to any know-
how or expertise, (collectively, the ""Confidential Information""), will be deemed
confidential/proprietary information of ACSC.  Greate Bay agrees that it shall
maintain the Confidential Information under secure conditions, using reasonable
security measures and in any event not less than the same security procedures
used by Greate Bay for the protection of its own confidential/proprietary
information.

(b)  Non-disclosure Obligation.  Except as may be requested or
required by or on behalf of any gaming authority, Greate Bay shall not disclose
any Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written
consent of ACSC. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Greate Bay may make the Software
or the SMS Software available, without ACSC's prior express consent, to any
independent consultant or consulting group retained by Greate Bay solely for
purposes specifically related to Greate Bay's permitted use, operation and
application of the Software or the SMS, but only after such independent
consultant or consulting group has executed a written confidentiality agreement
pursuant to which it covenants to not use the Confidential Information except
for Greate Bay as permitted herein and to not

<PAGE>

disclose the Confidential Information under the same conditions of
confidentiality contained herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Greate Bay may
disclose appropriate portions of Confidential Information to those of its
personnel who have a need to know the specific information in question in
connection with Greate Bay's rights or the performance of obligations under this
Agreement. All such personnel will be instructed by Greate Bay that the
Confidential Information is subject to the obligation of confidentiality set
forth by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Greate Bay may disclose
Confidential Information to an entity that is not a competitor of ACSC and is
offering (i) a Plan of Reorganization in the Chapter 11 Proceeding or (ii) to
purchase control of Greate Bay, provided however, that any such entity shall
enter into a non-disclosure agreement that requires such entity to protect such
information in the same manner as is required by this Paragraph 10.

(c) Equitable Remedies.  The obligations of Greate Bay in this
Paragraph 10 shall be specifically enforceable and Greate Bay agrees that (i)
any breach of Greate Bay's obligations under this Paragraph 10 would cause
irreparable injury to ACSC; (ii) ACSC would have an inadequate remedy at law for
any such breach; (iii) the balance of interests and hardships would favor an
injunction in favor of ACSC; (iv) the public interest would favor an injunction
in favor of ACSC, and (v) Greate Bay will make no legal arguments that equitable
relief is not an appropriate remedy in favor of ACSC in the event of a breach of
Greate Bay's obligations under this Paragraph.

11.  EXCLUSION OF INCIDENTAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.  NEITHER PARTY WILL
BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY (NOR TO ANY PERSON CLAIMING RIGHTS DERIVED FROM THE
OTHER PARTY'S RIGHTS) FOR INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR
EXEMPLARY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, including lost profits or revenue, loss of
business, or other economic damage, and further including injury to property, AS
A RESULT OF BREACH OF ANY WARRANTY OR OTHER TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS
OF WHETHER THE PARTY LIABLE OR ALLEGEDLY LIABLE WAS ADVISED OR HAD OTHER REASON
TO KNOW OR IN FACT KNEW OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.  Independent of, severable
from, and to be enforced independently of any other enforceable or unenforceable
provision of this Agreement, IN NO EVENT SHALL ACSC's AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO
GREATE BAY (INCLUDING TO ANY PERSON OR PERSONS WHOSE CLAIM OR CLAIMS ARE BASED
ON OR DERIVED FROM A RIGHT OR RIGHT CLAIMED BY GREATE BAY), WITH RESPECT TO ANY
AND ALL CLAIMS AT ANY AND ALL TIMES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THE SUBJECT
MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT, IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED ONE MILLION
DOLLARS ($1,000,000.00).

<PAGE>

12.  SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE.  The obligations of Greate Bay in this Agreement
shall be specifically enforceable by ACSC and Greate Bay agrees that (i) any
breach of Greate Bay's obligations under this Agreement would cause irreparable
injury to ACSC; (ii) ACSC would have an inadequate remedy at law for any such
breach; (iii) the balance of interests and hardships would favor an injunction
in favor of ACSC; (iv) the public interest would favor an injunction in favor of
ACSC, and (v) Greate Bay will make no legal arguments that equitable relief is
not an appropriate remedy in favor of ACSC in the event of a breach of Greate
Bay's obligations under this Agreement.

13.  ASSIGNMENT.  Greate Bay may not assign any right under this Agreement
and any purported assignment will be null and void and a breach of this
Agreement.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a change of control of
Greate Bay shall not constitute an assignment, and Greate Bay shall have the
right to assign its rights under this Agreement to any person or entity
acquiring substantially all of the assets of Greate Bay or at least 51 percent
of the equity of Greate Bay through purchase, merger, or reorganization and any
such person shall in turn have the right to assign to any other person coming
within the exception provided in this sentence.  ACSC shall have the right to
assign its rights under this Agreement provided that any such assignee shall
expressly assume ACSC's obligations to Greate Bay pursuant to this Agreement and
that the assignment shall include sufficient Intellectual Property, personnel
and other know how such that ACSC can reasonably expect the Assignee to be able
to fulfill the obligations to Greate Bay under this Agreement.

14.  AUTHORITY.  Each party represents and warrants to the other that each
party respectively has full right, power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and the person executing this Agreement on its behalf has actual
authority to do so.

This application also performs as the primary information data bank of
information specific to individual patrons gaming activity and
profitability.  Information from both table and slot activity is combined
with the ability to view this information and either combined or
independently.  A complimentary decision process has been incorporated so
that improved customer service may result by removing the requirement for
executive decisions on all issuances.
<PAGE>

EXHIBIT ""D""

CASINO SALES AND MARKETING SYSTEM


ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT
This module provides the ""housekeeping"" functions required to maintain an
accurate data bank of patron information for marketing purposes.  It also
serves to reduce cost specifically for the direct mail marketing
application and purging of inactive patrons.

EXTRACT MANAGEMENT
This is a flexible and robust patron selection module used primarily to
target specific segments of patrons for various marketing and/or analysis
functions.  The results of these extracts may be directed towards numerous
forms of processing.

GROUPS/INVITATION SYSTEM
The primary purpose of the group system is to enable the analysis of
profitability, both actual and potential, for up to twenty (20) user
defined groups or event types.  Expenses and/or complementaries may be
charged direct to a patrons account or as a percentage of theoretical
across all players within the group.  Groups may also include Branch
Offices and Junket Representatives with the ability to compute commissions.
Historical analysis by group type or monthly rep performance is provided.
The invitation module enables the booking of patrons responses to specific
events (i.e. Head liner shows).  Blocking of an event enables analysis
based on invited segment(s).

SWEEPSTAKES SYSTEM
The sweepstakes system provided for the controlling and winner selection
electronically for various promotional sweepstakes.  Entries earned by
patrons are automatically recorded with randomized winner selection based
on event, date and time of day.  If required entries may require pre-
qualification.  Linkage to the direct mail provides for notification of
entries.
<PAGE>

EXHIBIT ""E""

TABLE MARKETING SYSTEM

TABLE MARKETING SYSTEM (TMS)
TMS was developed as an extension of the SMS for table games and utilizes
the same network and controller boards (with function keypads and mark
sense printers).  The primary purposes of TMS consist of: a) control of
complementaries at the table games; b) access to patron information for
ratings, credit and tracking of cash transactions; and c) time and
attendance for pit personnel.
<PAGE>

EXHIBIT ""F'

CASINO ANALYSIS
This system provides the analysis department with information on patrons
gaming history.  Data extraction options allow flexibility in selecting
patron segments for analysis, and an interface to the Group system allows
group analysis.  Data can be interpreted in report format, or downloaded to
a PC for analysis utilizing PC based software, i.e. Foxpro.  Selections
from PC analysis can also be uploaded to the AS/400 to drive the Sales &
Marketing extract system.

MIS RESOURCE REQUEST SYSTEM
The MIS Resource Request system allows the entry and tracking of requests
for maintenance and new requests for Software, Hardware, and other services
provided by MIS.  The system utilizes control files to allow flexibility in
establishing Application areas and allows tracking of the progress of a
request from initial request entry through completion.  For Software
revisions, the system incorporates source and object movement to control
the development/testing cycle and movement to a production environment.
Tracking and reporting of man hours by request is also available.

SECURITY INCIDENT REPORTING SYSTEM
This system provides for the entry of Security Incident data to allow
tracking and reporting of various types of incidents.  Incidents can be
tracked from initiation through closure, and some limited claim/settlement
tracking is provided.

CROSS SYSTEM BACKUP (CSB)
This application is used in a multiple CPU environment to provide a 'hot'
backup capability, for use in the event of a severe hardware failure.  CSB
utilizes the Journaling feature of the AS/400 to capture changes to
designated application system files on a CPU, and transmits the changes to
another CPU, where the CSB application on this CPU applies the changes to
the application files residing on that CPU.

Macintosh and Windows operating systems, and to repackage,  manufacture, market,
distribute,  sell,  lease,  license and sub-license such revised and/or modified
Licensed  Software.  Such  revisions,  modifications  and  derivative  works are
referred to herein as ""Modified Software"". The foregoing licenses to Siboney are
subject to  NECTAR's  right set forth in Section 2 hereof,  and to any  licenses
previously  granted by NECTAR to  end-users of the  Licensed  Software.  Siboney
shall have no rights in the Licensed Software or Modified Software other than as
set forth in this Agreement.  NECTAR shall, as reasonably  requested by Siboney,
consult with Siboney concerning such revisions,  modifications and the like, and
all revisions and the like will be subject to NECTAR's approval, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld.  NECTAR shall receive one (1) copy of every commercial
product created pursuant to this license.

2. Marketing.  Siboney shall diligently develop, market and promote the
Modified Software. Decisions regarding the packaging, pricing and trademarks for
the Modified Software shall be made solely by Siboney.  NECTAR shall be notified
of the  initial  pricing  structure  and  any  subsequent  changes  in  pricing.
Notwithstanding  anything to the  contrary  in Section 1, NECTAR  shall have the
exclusive right to license,  market and distribute the Licensed  Software to its
existing distributors identified on Exhibit A hereto.

3. Duties Upon Execution. Upon execution of this Agreement, NECTAR will
provide  Siboney  with  all  source  code,  technical  information  and  content
documentation regarding the Licensed Software which NECTAR has in its possession
or under its control. NECTAR represents that copyright to the external functions
PostGrid and PostGraph in the source code is owned by Brain Waves Software, Inc.
NECTAR  cannot  provide this code or  information  about how to use the external
functions  using such Brain Waves  source code,  and Siboney  shall not use such
code.

4.  Earned  Royalties.  Siboney  will pay to  NECTAR  earned  royalties
(""Earned Royalties"") based on sales of the Modified Software, in an amount equal
to  twenty-two  and  one-half  percent  (22.5%) of  Siboney's  Net  Receipts for
Modified  Software.  Earned Royalties will accrue upon Siboney's  issuance of an
invoice for a Modified Software product.

5. Royalty Computation. ""Net Receipts"" are defined for purposes of this
Agreement as all consideration  received by Siboney or its affiliates,  directly
or  indirectly,  from  the  distribution,  publication,  lease,  sale  or  other
commercialization of the Modified Software,  as applicable,  less any discounts,
returns, sales or use taxes, refunds, freight, shipping and handling charges. If
Siboney  intends to license any Modified  Software  covered by this Agreement as
part of a package with other similar software, it shall first notify NECTAR. Net
Receipts for Modified  Software  licensed in such packages  shall be apportioned
based on the relative retail or suggested retail prices  reasonably  established
by Siboney for the various programs comprising the package.

6. Method of Payment; Audit. Siboney shall pay NECTAR applicable Earned
Royalties  for each calendar  quarter  hereafter,  beginning  December 31, 1998,
within 30 days following the end of each quarter in which Earned  Royalties have
accrued,  accompanied by a statement showing Net Receipts. NECTAR shall have the
right, not more than once each calendar year, upon reasonable  notice to Siboney
and during Siboney's  regular business hours, to have such  calculations and the
records on which  they are based  reviewed  by an  accountant  of its  choosing.
NECTAR's expenses in conjunction with any audit shall be reimbursable by Siboney
within 30 days of  presentation  of a written  statement  of  expenses  if it is
determined  that  there is more  than a ten  percent  (10%)  error in  Siboney's
statement  and/or  payment to NECTAR.  If such review  shows an  overpayment  by
Siboney,  then the amount of such  overpayment  shall be  promptly  refunded  by
NECTAR to Siboney.

<PAGE>

7. Guaranteed Minimum  Royalties.  Siboney will pay NECTAR a guaranteed
minimum royalty payment  totaling  $180,000 (in U.S.  Dollars).  This guaranteed
royalty will accrue in  specified  amounts  (each,  a  ""Guaranteed  Amount"") for
certain periods (each, a ""Guarantee  Period) and be payable as follows:  $30,000
will accrue on December 31, 1999 and be payable  January 31, 2000;  $60,000 will
accrue on  December  31, 2000 and be payable  January 31, 2001 and $90,000  will
accrue on December 31, 2001 and be payable  January 31, 2002.  Earned  Royalties
will be credited  against  the  applicable  Guaranteed  Amount,  if any.  Earned
Royalties for any Guarantee  Period in excess of the Guaranteed  Amount for that
period shall be credited  dollar for dollar to reduce the Guaranteed  Amount for
the following  guarantee period. For example,  if Earned Royalties accrued as of
December 31, 1999 total $40,000,  then the Guaranteed Amount payable January 31,
2001 shall be reduced to $50,000.  The guaranteed  minimum  royalty payment does
not affect  Siboney's  obligation to pay all Earned  Royalties  accrued during a
particular period.

8.  Ownership.  The Modified  Software shall be the property of NECTAR,
subject to Siboney's  exclusive license as defined herein, and Siboney agrees to
mark a copyright notice on each copy of Modified Software in the following form:
""? NECTAR Foundation.""

warrants and represents that it has full power and authority to grant the rights
granted in this Agreement without the consent of any other party.

Software does not infringe the copyright,  trademark,  trade secret or any other
proprietary  right,  or the right to privacy,  of any third  party,  and further
warrants that the Licensed Software does not contain any defamatory, libelous or
unlawful material.  NECTAR agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Siboney
from  and  against  any  third-party  claims,   demands,   liabilities,   suits,
proceedings and costs,  including  attorneys  fees,  incurred by Siboney arising
from any alleged breach of the warranty of NECTAR under this section.

11.  Claims of  Infringement.  Siboney  and NECTAR will give each other
prompt and complete  written notice  whenever either becomes aware of any actual
or impending  unauthorized  use of the Licensed  Software or Modified  Software.
Siboney  shall have complete  discretion to act or forebear  acting in regard to
such actual or impending  unauthorized use. NECTAR,  however, shall cooperate at
Siboney's sole expense with Siboney and follow  Siboney's  directions if Siboney
elects to act in regard to such actual or  impending  unauthorized  use, and any
recovery  awarded  to or paid as a result of any  action  undertaken  by Siboney
shall belong  solely to Siboney.  If Siboney,  however,  shall elect not to act,
NECTAR  shall be deemed  authorized  to act at its own expense on its own behalf
and any recovery shall belong solely to NECTAR.

12.  Term and  Termination.  This  Agreement  shall be  effective  upon
execution and shall remain in effect until  terminated  by either party.  NECTAR
may  terminate  this  Agreement  after  December 31, 2001, on 6 months notice to

$30,000 (in U.S.  Dollars).  Siboney may  terminate  this  Agreement on 6 months
notice any time after  December  31,  2001.  Upon  termination  pursuant to this

Siboney shall have no rights to license or distribute any Modified  Software not
invoiced as of the end of the 6-month period and (c) Siboney  remains  obligated
for Earned Royalties due on Modified  Software invoiced prior to the end of such
6-month period. This Agreement will be terminated  automatically upon the filing
of a petition in bankruptcy by or against Siboney.

13.  Breach.  In the  event of a breach  of any  material  term of this
Agreement, the non-breaching party shall provide a notice of breach to the other
party,  which notice shall specify the nature of the breach.  If the  defaulting
party  fails to cure the  breach  within the  thirty-day  period  following  its

""4.1 Siboney will pay to NECTAR earned royalties  (""Earned  Royalties"")
based on sales  of the  Modified  Software  for any  MathTrek  software
program  (""Modified  MathTrek  Software""),  as follows:  Effective  for
Earned Royalties accrued prior to July 1, 1999, Siboney will pay NECTAR

such purposes after entering into a written confidentiality agreement with

provision. Duke acknowledges that Licensed Software and the user and
maintenance instructions for the Licensed Software are not CONFIDENTIAL
INFORMATION except for those portions of the Documentation that Duke has
explicitly indicated to be Confidential.

EXHIBIT A:  DICOM CLIENT LIBRARY

The Client DICOM Library consists of a group of routines available to
application programmers. It provides the functions needed to manage receipt of
certain classes of medical images across a TCP/IP network. The client library
supports the ability to query and retrieve images and associated information
(Query/Retrieve) from a DICOM server. It also provides a means of storing images
from a remote server using the move functions, as well as basic DICOM print
functions as outlined below. Only the basic DICOM features needed to provide the
conformance as outlined below are included as licensed software.

The DICOM client library provides support for the following DICOM V3.0 SOP
Classes as a SCP (due to the support of the C-GET service):

4.1 Licensor represents and warrants that it owns the Software, Documentation

acknowledges and agrees that all copyright, patent, trade secret, trademark, and
all other intellectual property rights of whatever nature in the Software,
Documentation, and Specifications are and shall remain the property of Licensor,
and nothing in this Agreement should be construed as transferring any aspects of
such rights to Licensee or any third party. Any upgrades, improvements or
modifications to, or new versions of, the Software shall become a part of the
Software, and, as such, are subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, whether such upgrades, improvements, modifications or new versions
are made by Licensor or Licensee. Additionally, Licensor shall own all
proprietary rights associated with such upgrades, improvements, modifications or
new versions. Licensee hereby agrees that the foregoing provisions apply
similarly to upgrades, improvements or modifications to, or new versions of, the
Software made by Licensee prior to the execution of this Agreement.

4.2 ""Confidential Information"" shall mean the Software, Documentation, and
Specifications. Licensee acknowledges the confidential and proprietary nature of
the Confidential Information and agrees that it shall not reveal or disclose any
Confidential Information for any purpose to any other person, firm, corporation
or other entity, other than Licensee's employees with the need to know such
Confidential Information to perform employment responsibilities consistent with
Licensee's rights under this Agreement. Licensee shall safeguard and protect the
Confidential Information from theft, piracy, or unauthorized access in a manner
at least consistent with the protections Licensee uses to protect its most
confidential information. Licensee shall inform its employees of its obligations
under this Agreement, and shall take such steps as may be reasonable in the
circumstances, or as may be reasonably requested by Licensor, to prevent any
unauthorized disclosure, copying, or use of the Confidential Information.
Licensee acknowledges and agrees that in the event of Licensee's breach of this
provision, Licensor will suffer irreparable injuries not compensated by monetary
damages and therefore shall not have an adequate remedy at law. Accordingly,
Licensor shall be entitled to a preliminary and final injunction without the
necessity of posting bond. This remedy is separate and apart from any other
remedy Licensor may have.

3

<PAGE>

4.3 Licensee shall notify Licensor immediately upon discovery of any prohibited

to inspect, use and assess the Software and that, as of such date, the Software
meets all of Licensee's requirements and expectations and operates without
Errors.

5.2 LICENSOR EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. LICENSOR

THE LIABILITY OF LICENSOR TO LICENSEE FOR ANY REASON AND UPON ANY CAUSE OF
ACTION SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID TO LICENSOR BY LICENSEE UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT. THIS LIMITATION APPLIES TO ALL CAUSES OF ACTION IN THE AGGREGATE,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, TO BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY,
NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, MISREPRESENTATIONS, AND OTHER TORTS.

selling expenses, underwriting discounts and related costs) from such investors
to be paid to Licensor and applied by Licensor to the satisfaction of all
obligations due to Licensor or its affiliates and subsidiaries from Licensee and
its subsidiaries and affiliates. Such application shall be deemed satisfaction
of such obligations to Licensor and its affiliates and subsidiaries only to the
extent of such value received and so applied. If such amounts paid to Licensor
by Licensee exceed the total obligations due from Licensee and its affiliates
and subsidiaries to Licensor and its affiliates and subsidiaries, then Licensor
shall return the excess to Licensee. To the extent that Licensee fails to issue
Series A Preferred Stock as of the end of such 90 day period in accordance with
the foregoing terms, or otherwise satisfy its obligations to

<PAGE>

Licensor and its affiliates and subsidiaries, then, on the last day of such
period, Licensee shall validly authorize, and immediately thereafter begin to
validly issue, to Licensor or its designee, in one or more tranches, that number
of duly authorized, fully paid and nonassessable shares of the Series A
Preferred Stock that shall have a value, in the aggregate, equal to the total
amount payable upon acceleration under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section
6.5, and a per share value equal to the price per share of the Common Stock on
the date that such Series A Preferred Stock is issued to Licensor, less 25% of
such per share price, in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of
Designations and the Registration Rights Agreement, each of which shall be in
the form attached hereto as Exhibits B and C, respectively. Licensor agrees that
within 90 days after such issuance, it shall give Licensee notice of its
election to either (1) sell its shares of Series A Preferred Stock (or the
shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series A Preferred Stock are
convertible) or (2) retain the shares of Series A Preferred Stock or the Common
Stock into which such Series A Preferred Stock is convertible. Cash amounts
received upon transfer or sale by the Licensor (net of selling expenses,
underwriting discounts and related costs) of such Series A Preferred Stock (or
the Common Stock into which it is convertible), or the value (on an as-converted
to Common Stock basis) of any shares retained as provided in clause (2) above,
shall be applied by the Licensor against amounts due hereunder. Such application
shall be deemed satisfaction of such obligations to Licensor and its affiliates
and subsidiaries only to the extent of such value received and so applied.
Notwithstanding the length of any period specified herein, and regardless of the
election made by Licensor hereunder, Licensee agrees to continue to issue, and
Licensor retains its right to require such additional issuances of, Series A
Preferred Stock, until such time as the aggregate amount of cash received by
Licensor, or the value of such issued shares of Series A Preferred Stock, as
applicable in clause (2) above, equals the value of all obligations due to
Licensor and its affiliates and subsidiaries from Licensee and its affiliates
and subsidiaries, all in accordance with the terms hereof (such terms to
include, but not be limited to, the 25% discount with respect to per share
pricing). If the value received by Licensor exceeds the total obligations due
from Licensee and its affiliates and subsidiaries to Licensor and its affiliates
and subsidiaries, then Licensor shall return the excess to Licensee within ten
(10) days after Licensor receives notice of such overpayment from Licensee.
Licensee further agrees that it (a) shall appropriately and timely file the
Certificate of Designations with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, and shall file such certificates of amendment to same as Licensor
deems necessary in the exercise of its reasonable discretion; (b) shall obtain
all requisite approvals from its shareholders, including, without limitation,
the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock; (c) shall at all times reserve and
keep available out of its authorized shares of Common Stock (as defined in the
certificate of incorporation of the Licensee), solely for the purpose of issue
or delivery upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, the maximum number
of shares of Common Stock that may be issuable or deliverable upon such
conversion, and shall issue such shares of Common Stock in accordance with the
terms of its certificate of incorporation and the Registration Rights Agreement;
and (d) obtain and provide to Licensor an opinion of counsel (who shall be
satisfactory to Licensor) to the effect that the shares of Series A Preferred
Stock shall be duly authorized and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

The rights and remedies of the Licensor contained in this Agreement are
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies otherwise provided by
law.

RECITALS

WHEREAS,  Licensor is the owner of certain computer  software  programs
and related  documentation  pertaining to the  authorization and capture of data
transactions originating with the use of payment cards; and

WHEREAS, Licensor desires to grant to Licensee, and Licensee desires to
obtain a  non-exclusive,  fully paid license to use certain of those programs on
the terms and conditions set forth herein.

NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of the foregoing and of the mutual
covenants contained herein, the parties agree as follows:

1.       Grant of License.

1.1 License.  Licensor  hereby grants to Licensee,  and Licensee hereby
accepts,  subject to the terms and  conditions  set forth in this  Agreement,  a
non-exclusive,  non-transferable,  perpetual license in the United States to (a)

and owned by Licensor  and any changes or  additions  thereto  made  pursuant to
Section  3 below  (the  ""Licensed  Software"");  and  (b)  use any  documentation
developed by Licensee relating to the Licensed Software. Licensed Software shall
include  documentation,   scripts,   database  stored  procedures,   and  binary
executable  code.  Licensed  Software does not include any Source Code.  ""Source
Code""  means the  version of the  Licensed  Software  in  assembly  language  or
high-level  language  which must be assembled or compiled so that a computer can
execute the program.

1.2 Title to Software. The Licensed Software shall remain the exclusive
property of  Licensor.  Licensee  shall not acquire any title to or ownership of
the   Licensed   Software   under  or  by  reason  of  this   Agreement  or  any
customizations,  enhancements  or upgrades that might be made by Licensor at the
request of Licensee.
Licensee will ensure that all copies of the Licensed  Software are
conspicuously marked with Licensor's copyright notice as follows:

""This  Product  has been  provided  and may be used only under the
terms and conditions of an Agreement,  which includes restrictions
on copying and transfer to third parties. No title or ownership to
this Product is hereby transferred.""

2.       License Fee.

2.1 Issuance of Stock. In consideration  of Licensor's  granting of the
License,  Licensee  shall grant to Licensor  three  hundred  thousand  (300,000)
shares of Licensee's common stock (""Stock""),  having an expected market value of
One Million Dollars  ($1,000,000) to be delivered no later than thirty (30) days
after the date of this Agreement (the ""Delivery  Date"").  If the market value of
Stock is less than $3 1/3 per  share,  (split-adjusted)  at the  Delivery  Date,
Licensee  shall  deliver  sufficient  additional  Stock  of up  to  seventy-five
thousand  (75,000)  shares to return the  aggregate  market value to One Million
Dollars ($1,000,000). If the market value of Stock is less than $2 2/3 per share
(split-adjusted)  at the Delivery Date, the total  consideration  received under
this Agreement  shall be limited to 375,000 shares  multiplied by the applicable
market value per share.  The  Licensee's  Common  stock will have a  restrictive
legend  attached and be subject to the terms and  conditions  of rule 144 of the

3.       Updates and Maintenance.

3.1 Upon the  completion  of any  maintenance  or  enhancements  to the
Licensed  Software  made by Licensor for its own benefit  during the term of the
Management  Services Agreement (an ""Update""),  such Update shall be installed on
the  Maverick  Systems and  operated  for  Licensor  and shall be  automatically
included in the license granted herein to Licensee,  at no extra charge,  unless
such  Update was  developed  or created at  Licensee's  request,  in which event
Licensee shall pay to Licensor a fee of Licensor's direct  development cost plus
25% markup for the  development  of such Update.  In the event Licensee has paid
Licensor for the Update and Licensor  subsequently  wishes to use the Update for
its  own  benefit,  Licensor  shall  reimburse  Licensee  for  one-half  of  the
development  fee.  Notwithstanding  any request for  development or payment of a
development  fee by  Licensor,  the  resulting  Update shall remain the sole and
exclusive property of Licensor.

4.       Installation and Operation of Licensed Software.

4.1  Designated  Site.  During  the  term  of the  Management  Services
Agreement  the Software  shall reside only on systems  belonging to or under the
control of Licensor (the ""Maverick  System"") and will be operated by Licensor on
behalf of Licensee under the terms of said  agreement.  Upon  termination of the
Management  Services  Agreement,  Licensee may designate a single  domestic site
where it wishes to have the Software installed (the ""Designated Site"") and shall
provide  written  notice of the date upon  which it wishes  the  software  to be
delivered (the ""Delivery Date"");  provided,  however, such notice shall be given
no later than one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the Delivery  Date."" In the
event of a  termination  for cause by USWD,  the Delivery  Date shall be no more
than  thirty (30) days after such  termination.  Licensor  will  deliver two (2)
copies of the  production  version of the  Licensed  Software as it exists as of
fourteen  (14) days prior to the Delivery  Date and will install one (1) copy at
the Designated Site promptly but no later than fourteen (14) business days after
the Delivery Date.

4.2 Licensee to Prepare Designated Site. Licensee shall arrange to have
the  Designated  Site  prepared  and  ready  for  installation  of the  Licensed
Software,  at  Licensee's  sole expense.  Licensor  agrees that its cost for any
assistance in site  preparation,  installation  and training shall be limited to
its  direct  costs,  including,  but not  limited  to salary  and  benefits  for
personnel  and  out-of-pocket  travel  expenses,  plus a markup  of  twenty-five
percent (25%).

4.3  Hardware.  Promptly  upon receipt of notice of the Delivery  Date,

cabling and  electrical  power for that  system.  In the event of any  conflicts
between  the  written  environmental  or  technical  specifications  provided by
Licensor  and those of any  manufacturer  of  hardware  being  used for the USWD
System,  Licensee shall follow the  specifications  of the  manufacturer of such
hardware.

4.4 Maintenance.  After delivery of Licensed  Software,  Licensor shall

delivery,  Licensee shall be have the right, subject to Exhibit A, to customize,

not acquire any title or ownership of the underlying Licensed Software by reason
thereof.

5.  Confidential  Information  and  Non-Disclosure.
Licensor and Licensee each  acknowledges  that in the course of  performing  its
obligations  hereunder,  it may receive,  develop or otherwise  acquire  certain
information  that the other  party  deems as its  proprietary  and  confidential
information  (""Confidential  Information"").  All  Confidential  Information of a
party  that the other  party may now  possess,  may  obtain  during or after the
performance of this Agreement will be held  confidential by the receiving party,
and that party will not (nor will it assist any other  person to do so) directly
or indirectly reveal, report, publish or disclose such Confidential  Information
to any person, firm or corporation not expressly  authorized by the party owning
such Confidential Information to receive such Confidential  Information,  or use
(or assist any person to use) such Confidential  Information  except (a) for the
benefit of the party  owing the  Confidential  Information  and in the course of

concerning  the  advisability  of seeking a  protective  order or other means of
preserving  the  confidentiality  of the  Confidential  Information.  Each party

costs) at its own  expense.  Licensee  is obliged to notify  Licensor in writing
immediately upon receipt of any such claim giving full details,  and may make no
statements  prejudicial to Licensor  unless forced thereto  according to Arizona
law. In no event shall Licensee  settle any such claims,  lawsuit or proceedings
without  Licensor's  prior  written  approval.  Licensee  shall  cooperate  with

to infringement of any patents, trademarks,  copyrights, licenses or other third

9.4 Licensor shall not be liable for  infringements of intellectual and
industrial  property  rights if Licensee  has  altered any part of the  Licensed

has any right to use the Licensed Software.  No part of any license fee shall be
returned to Licensee upon termination unless caused by Licensor's  default.  The
term  ""default""  as used in this  Agreement  shall  include the  institution  of
proceedings by or against either party under federal or state  bankruptcy  laws,
or an assignment or receivership for the benefit of creditors.

the State of Arizona. If a dispute concerning this Agreement arises, the parties
will  first  meet and  attempt to  resolve  the  matter in good  faith.  If such

contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:



Section 1 — GRANT OF LICENSE




1.1 Grant of License. Subject to the terms and conditions herein, Licensor hereby grants to
Licensee during the Term a fully paid-up, non-exclusive license (i) to install, copy and distribute

Licensee’s operation of its business (subject to Section 8.1 of this Agreement), and (ii) to copy
and distribute internally, use and create Improvements to any related documentation developed by
Licensor that pertains to the operation of the Software (“Related Documentation”).



1.2 Third Party Software. The license in Section 1 is conditioned upon Licensee’s prior
acquisition, at Licensee’s expense, of a license to all third party software, applications, code or
other proprietary data or information set forth on Schedule B (“Third Party Software”) sufficient
to enable Licensee to enjoy such license as set forth herein.



1.3 Provision of Software and Related Documentation. Promptly after the Effective Date,
Licensor shall provide Licensee (i) the most current copies of the source code for the Software, if
available, (ii) copies of the Software in executable form, and (iii) copies of the Related

Related Documentation or the enforceability of this Agreement, including without limitation, in any

is sought; nor shall Licensee willingly become a party adverse to Licensor in any Action in which a
third party contests same.

solely as provided by Section 7.01 of the respective Exhibitor’s Exhibitor Services Agreement. Each Exhibitor agrees that in connection with its use of the Company Technology as permitted under its Exhibitor Services Agreement, it will

3.1 License by the Company.
3.1.1 License to Exhibitors. As soon as practicable following the Effective Date, the Company will notify the Exhibitors in writing of all Company Developments in existence as of the Effective Date. The Company hereby grants to each
Exhibitor a perpetual, exclusive, worldwide, royalty free license to use, make, have made, copy, perform, and create derivative works of all Developments of the Company in existence as of the Effective Date only outside of the Field of Use (but
excluding Digital Cinema Services) solely for the Exhibitor’s internal business purposes. The foregoing license includes the right to have independent contractors, including without limitation DCIP, prepare derivative works and modifications to
the Developments. This license shall be exclusive, even as to Company, outside the Field of Use (but excluding Digital Cinema Services). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Company has no obligation to provide AMC or Cinemark, and the
license set forth in the preceding sentence expressly excludes, any Developments consisting of Source Code for improvements to the In-Theatre DCS Software. The Company shall deliver to each Exhibitor any Development licensed under this
Section 3.1.1, in both object code and Source Code format, as soon as












practicable after the Effective Date. Within a reasonable period of time not to exceed thirty (30) days following the Effective Date, representatives
designated by the Company and each of the Exhibitors shall meet to agree in good faith upon a plan and schedule for the transfer and delivery of the Developments licensed under this Section 3.1.1. Any Source Code licensed by the Company
pursuant to this Section 3.1.1 will be treated by the Exhibitor as Confidential Information, but may be disclosed to persons who have a need for such Source Code for purposes of advancing the business of the Exhibitors outside of the Field of
Use (but excluding Digital Cinema Services) and who are legally bound in advance to treat such Source Code as Confidential Information. Upon request of an Exhibitor, Source Code can be put into escrow for the benefit and at the expense of the
Exhibitor subject to the reasonable approval of the escrow agreement by Company.
3.1.2 License to DCIP. The Company will reasonably
promptly notify DCIP in writing of any Company Development if the Development may have application to the delivery of Digital Cinema Services. The Company hereby grants to DCIP a perpetual, exclusive, worldwide, royalty free license to use, make,
have made, copy, perform, and create derivative works of and sub-license any such Developments of the Company, in both object code and Source Code format, only for Digital Cinema Services. This license shall be exclusive, even as to Company, for
Digital Cinema Services. Company shall deliver to DCIP any Development licensed under this Section 3.1.2, in both object code and Source Code format, (a) no later than thirty (30) days after Company’s good faith determination
that such Development may have application to Digital Cinema Services, and (b) at any time upon DCIP’s request. Any Source Code licensed by the Company pursuant to this Section 3.1.2, will (i) not be disclosed in any manner by or
on behalf of DCIP to any Exhibitor under any circumstances, and (ii) in all other circumstances be treated by DCIP as Confidential Information. For purposes of clarification, the foregoing does not restrict DCIP from disclosing the following to
the Exhibitors as Confidential Information, (1) information regarding the design or operation of the Developments licensed to DCIP under this Section 3.1.2, or (2) the Source Code to any DCIP developments based on the Source Code
licensed by Company pursuant to this Section 3.1.2, provided, however, that in each of (1) and (2) the unmodified Source Code licensed by Company pursuant to this Section 3.1.2 is not disclosed to the Exhibitors.
Upon request of DCIP, Source Code can be put into escrow for the benefit and at the expense of DCIP subject to the reasonable approval of the escrow agreement by Company.
3.2 License by the Exhibitors. While each Exhibitor has granted the Company the exclusive right to create derivative works of the Original Technology within the Field of Use (except as may be
provided in Section 9), each Exhibitor will as soon as practicable following the Effective Date notify the Company in writing of any Exhibitor Development in existence as of the Effective Date if such Development may have application in the
Field of Use. Except for Source Code, which is covered in Section 2.2 herein, each Exhibitor hereby grants to the Company a perpetual, exclusive, royalty free license in the Territory to use, make, have made, copy, perform, display, create
derivative works of and sub-license any such Developments of such Exhibitor, but only in the Field of Use. Except as may be provided in Section 2.4, the












license shall be exclusive, even as to the Exhibitors, in the Field of Use. AMC has no obligation to provide the Company with Developments consisting of
Source Code for improvements to its DTDS Software. Each of the Exhibitors shall deliver to the Company any Development licensed under Section 2.2 in Source Code format and this Section 3.2 in object code format only as soon as practicable
after the Effective Date. Within a reasonable period of time not to exceed thirty (30) days following the Effective Date, representatives designated by the Company and each of the Exhibitors shall meet to agree in good faith upon a plan and
schedule for the transfer and delivery of the Developments licensed under this Section 3.2.
3.3 License by DCIP. DCIP
will reasonably promptly notify the Company in writing of any DCIP Development if the Development may have application in the Field of Use. DCIP hereby grants to the Company a perpetual, exclusive, royalty free license in the Territory to use, make,
have made, copy, perform, display, create derivative works of and sub-license any such Developments of DCIP, in both object code and Source Code format, but only in the Field of Use. Except as may be provided in Section 2.4, the license shall
be exclusive, even as to DCIP, in the Field of Use. DCIP shall deliver to the Company any Development licensed under this Section 3.3, in both object code and Source Code format, (a) no later than thirty (30) days after DCIP’s
good faith determination that such Development may have application in the Field of Use, and (b) at any time upon the Company’s request.
4.

Agreement; provided, however, in the event such taxes are due, the Company will be responsible for paying them.
5. Representations And
Warranties; Disclaimer. Each Party represents and warrants to the other that: (a) it has full power to enter into this Agreement, to carry out its obligations under this Agreement and to grant the rights and licenses granted under this
Agreement; and (b) its compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement will not violate laws or regulations applicable to such Party or any third party agreements to which it is a party. EXCEPT FOR THE WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY PROVIDED
FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY HEREBY DISCLAIMS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING THE WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
6. Confidentiality. Confidential Information of one Party that is disclosed to or observed by other Parties pursuant to this Agreement will be governed by
the provisions of Section 10.3 of the Operating Agreement, except as otherwise expressly permitted in Section 3.1.1 and 8.1. For purposes of this Agreement the provisions of Section 10.3 of the Operating Agreement will survive and
bind each Party for a period of 3 years after any expiration of such Party’s rights under this Agreement.
7. Noncompetition.

7.1 Covenants. Throughout the term of this Agreement and notwithstanding the termination of any Exhibitor’s Exhibitor
Services Agreement (the “Noncompetition Period”), (a)












Company shall not, directly or indirectly, as an owner, shareholder, joint venturer, advisor, consultant or otherwise, engage in any activity that competes
with or is enhanced by DCIP’s business or activities within Digital Cinema Services without the prior written consent of DCIP, which DCIP may withhold in its absolute discretion, and (b) DCIP shall not, directly or indirectly, as an owner,
shareholder, joint venturer, advisor, consultant or otherwise, engage in any activity that competes with or is enhanced by Company’s business or activities within the Field of Use without the prior written consent of Company, which Company may
withhold in its absolute discretion.
7.2 Acknowledgments. Company and DCIP (the “Noncompetition Parties”) each
acknowledge that the foregoing restriction on competition is fair and reasonable under the circumstances and necessary in order to protect and preserve the business interests of each Noncompetition Party. Company also acknowledges that as a result
of its engagement with DCIP, Company will have access to information and materials that would be valuable or useful to Digital Cinema Services. DCIP likewise acknowledges that as a result of its engagement with Company, DCIP will have access to
information and materials that would be valuable or useful in the Field of Use. Each Noncompetition Party therefore acknowledges that the foregoing restrictions on its future business activities are fair and reasonable.
7.3 Remedies. Each Noncompetition Party acknowledges, covenants and agrees that (a) irreparable loss and damage will be
suffered by the protected Noncompetition Party if the obligated Noncompetition Party should breach or violate any of the covenants and agreements contained in this Section 7, and (b) in addition to any other remedies available to the
protected Noncompetition Party, the protected Noncompetition Party shall be entitled to injunctive relief against the obligated Noncompetition Party to prevent a breach or contemplated breach by the obligated Noncompetition Party of any of the
covenants or agreements contained herein without the requirement of posting a bond.
8. Rights upon Termination of an Exhibitor Services
Agreement.
8.1 Termination for Material Breach by the Company. As soon as practicable prior to the termination of an
Exhibitor’s Exhibitor Services Agreement other than as a result of a material breach by such Exhibitor pursuant to either of subsections 9.02 (a) or (b) of such Exhibitor Services Agreement, (i) a copy of the Company Technology
in existence as of the Effective Date will be distributed to the Exhibitor; (ii) the Company’s license of that Exhibitor’s Original Technology and that Exhibitor’s Developments pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall
automatically convert to a non-exclusive license without the requirement of further action by any Party; and (iii) the Exhibitor shall have the perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty free right and license to use, make, have made, copy,
perform, display and create derivative works of the Company Technology in existence as of the Effective Date, subject to the restrictions herein. With the exception of the Exhibitor’s Original Technology and Developments, the use of which shall
be unrestricted after the termination of the Exhibitor’s Exhibitor Services Agreement (1) the Exhibitor shall be permitted to use the Company Technology distributed pursuant to this Section 8.1 only for its internal business purposes
in its












own Theatres; and (2) the Source Code included in the Company Technology distributed pursuant to this Section 8.1 will be maintained by the
Exhibitor as Confidential Information, but may be disclosed to persons who have a need for such Source Code for purposes of advancing the internal business of the Exhibitors and who are legally bound in advance to treat such Source Code as
Confidential Information.
8.2 In-Theatre DCS Software. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, upon any termination
as provided in this Article 8, or other distribution of Company Technology as may be permitted hereunder, the Company shall have no right or obligation to provide to AMC or Cinemark, and AMC and Cinemark shall not receive access or any rights to,
any Source Code for the In-Theatre DCS Software, or any Developments consisting of Source Code for improvements to the In-Theatre DCS Software.
9.
Ownership.
9.1 Original Technology. Except for the rights expressly granted to Company under this
Agreement, each Exhibitor will retain all right, title and interest in and to the Original Technology of that Exhibitor, including all worldwide Technology and intellectual property and proprietary rights therein and related thereto.
9.2 Exhibitor Developments. Except for the rights expressly granted under this Agreement, each Exhibitor will retain all right, title and
interest in and to any Developments authored, conceived of and reduced to practice, or otherwise developed solely by that Exhibitor, including all worldwide Technology and intellectual property and proprietary rights therein and related thereto, and
such Developments shall be made available to Company pursuant to the license set forth in Section 3.2 hereof.
9.3 DCIP
Developments. Except for the rights expressly granted under this Agreement, DCIP will retain all right, title and interest in and to any Developments authored, conceived of and reduced to practice, or otherwise developed by DCIP, including
all worldwide Technology and intellectual property and proprietary rights therein and related thereto, and such Developments shall be made available to Company pursuant to the license set forth in Section 3.3 hereof.
9.4 Company Developments. Except for the rights expressly granted under this Agreement, Company will retain all right, title and interest
in and to any Developments authored, conceived of and reduced to practice, or otherwise developed by Company, including all worldwide Technology and intellectual property and proprietary rights therein and related thereto, and such Developments
shall be made available to the Exhibitors and DCIP pursuant to the license set forth in Section 3.1 hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ownership of Developments authored, conceived of and reduced to practice, or otherwise developed by
Company in connection or collaboration with any Exhibitors shall be negotiated by the relevant Parties in good faith on case-by-case basis.
9.5 Other Joint Developments. To the extent not addressed in the Operating Agreement, an Exhibitor Services Agreement, or any other agreement existing between the












Parties, the Parties contemplate that the ownership of any new Technology developments not related to the Original Technology developed under this Agreement
will be determined in accordance with a separate written agreement relating to the development of that Technology, provided that if no such separate agreement is signed between the Parties, the ownership of any such Technology will be determined in
accordance with applicable intellectual property laws. In the event that Parties who jointly own Technology agree to file a patent application or copyright registration in connection therewith, each such Party will be responsible for an equal share
of the costs associated with such filing. Such Parties will agree on which Party shall be responsible for filing and maintaining the resulting intellectual property rights. If all Parties who jointly own the Technology in question are not able to
agree on whether to file the application or registration, the other applicable Parties may proceed, and the non-proceeding Party will cooperate as reasonably requested in connection therewith at the expense of the Party or Parties that are
proceeding with the application or registration, and the Parties who are proceeding will own any resulting patent or copyright. If the Parties who jointly own Technology determine that a third party may be infringing upon any of that Technology,
they shall notify the other Parties and shall discuss the possibility of acting together to halt such infringement. If the parties cannot agree within three months of such notice to take any action to halt such infringement, then the Party or
Parties who are interested in acting may take independent action without the participation of the other Party. In such case, the non-acting Parties will provide all reasonable assistance requested by the acting Party in halting the infringement,
including, for example, becoming a party to any litigation action if such is required for the action to proceed. The proceeding Parties shall share equally in any financial return from such action without an obligation to share with the
non-participating Party.
10. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT FOR A BREACH OF ANY PARTY’S CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS, THE GROSS
NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF ANY PARTY, OR AN INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF ANY PARTY’S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, NO PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE,
EXEMPLARY OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
11. General Terms.

11.1 Entire Agreement and Amendment. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements, oral and written, between the parties
with respect to its subject matter and constitutes a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement between the parties with respect to its subject matter. This Agreement may not be amended except by a written agreement executed by
the party to be charged with the amendment.
11.2 Effect of Related Agreements on DCIP. DCIP agrees to be bound
(a) by the meaning given to the term “Service” in the Exhibitor Services Agreement, (b) as a “Member” for purposes of Section 10.3 of the Operating Agreement, as provided in Section 6 hereof, and (c) by
the provisions of Section 10.10 of the Operating Agreement, as provided in Section 11.7 hereof.










11.3 Waiver; Remedies. The waiver or failure of a Party to exercise in any respect any
right provided hereunder shall not be deemed a waiver of such right in the future or a waiver of any other rights established under this Agreement. All remedies available to any Party hereto for breach of this Agreement are cumulative and may be
exercised concurrently or separately, and the exercise of any one remedy shall not be deemed an election of such remedy to the exclusion of other remedies.
11.4 Assignment. No Party may assign or transfer, by operation of law or otherwise, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement to any third party without all other Parties’ prior written
consent. Any Party may fulfill its obligations hereunder by using third-party vendors or subcontractors; provided, however, that such Party shall remain fully and primarily responsible to ensure that such obligations are satisfied. A
Permitted Transfer and, to the extent not deemed a Permitted Transfer, any assignment or transfer by DCIP to an Exhibitor or by any Exhibitor to DCIP, including without limitation an assignment or transfer in the event of a dissolution or winding up
of DCIP or any of the Exhibitors, shall not be deemed an assignment or transfer for purposes of this Agreement; provided, however, that regardless of whether such assignment or transfer is deemed a Permitted Transfer, any assignment or
transfer by DCIP to an Exhibitor under this Agreement shall be subject to continued compliance by the Exhibitor with the provisions of this Agreement applicable to DCIP prior to such transfer. Any Permitted Transfer by assignment to an Affiliate of
an Exhibitor shall be (i) conditioned upon (A) the transferee entering into an Assignment and Assumption, (B) the Exhibitor agreeing in writing to remain bound by the obligations under this Agreement, and (ii) effective only so
long as the Affiliate remains an Affiliate of transferee. Any attempted assignment in violation of this Section shall be void. The Company, DCIP and each Exhibitor acknowledges and agrees that in the event of the sale of all or substantially all of
its assets, the failure to include (by operation of law or otherwise) the assignment of its interest in this Agreement in respect of such assets as part of the sale shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
this Agreement shall not be assignable by a Party unless the assignee expressly assumes in writing all of the obligations of the assignor hereunder. Any attempted assignment in violation of this section shall be void.
11.5 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other
provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Any provision of this Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or degree will remain in full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable.

11.6 Section Headings, Construction. The headings of Sections in this Agreement are provided for convenience only and will not affect
its construction or interpretation. All references to “Section” or “Sections” refer to the corresponding Section or Sections of this Agreement.
11.7 Governing Law, Dispute Resolution. Any dispute arising under this Agreement shall be subject to the provisions of Section 10.10 of the Operating Agreement with respect to governing law and
dispute resolution, which provisions are hereby fully incorporated












herein and made a part hereof; provided, however, that the Parties further agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement and is hereby disclaimed by the Parties.
11.8
Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the
same agreement.
11.9 Independent Contractors. Each of Regal, AMC, Cinemark, DCIP and the Company shall act solely as
an independent contractor, and nothing herein shall at any time be construed to create the relationship of employer and employee, partnership, principal and agent, broker or finder, or joint venturers as among Regal, AMC, Cinemark, DCIP and the
Company. No Party shall have any right or authority, and shall not attempt, to enter into any contract, commitment or agreement or incur any debt or liability of any nature, in the name of or on behalf of any other party.
11.10 Bankruptcy. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the license rights granted in this Agreement, including specifically but
without limitation the rights to use, modify, and create derivative works of Source Code, are intended to survive and continue unimpaired by the insolvency or bankruptcy of the licensor, and that this Agreement shall be deemed to be, for purposes of
the Bankruptcy Code, a license to “intellectual property” as such term is used in Sections 365(n) and 101(35A) thereof.
11.11
Survival. This Agreement shall survive the liquidation or dissolution of the Company. The rights granted pursuant to this Agreement, including without limitation the license rights granted in Sections 2 and 3 above, are intended to be
perpetual and irrevocable.

4.       LICENSEE'S COMMITMENT

Licensee  through  the  execution  of this  Agreement  agrees to license  and/or
purchase  [REDACTED] of  the Software  Products as described  in  Appendix A and
the Statement of Work (the ""1998  Commitment"").  The Software Products described
in the Statement of Work will be delivered/performed on basis of purchase orders
as may be  agreed  to by the  parties.  Such  purchase  orders  are for  project
management  purposes  only  and do not affect Licensee's  commitment to license
and/or purchase the Software Products as described in the Statement of Work.

For a period  [REDACTED]  following  the  Effective  Date,  until  Licensee  has
purchased or licensed Software Products manufactured by Lucent's  Communications
Software  Group  or  its  successor   business  unit  or  stand-alone   software
manufactured by Lucent (""CS Software Products"") with a purchase or license price
not less than  [REDACTED],  Lucent will be considered by Licensee as a preferred
supplier  of  Software   Products  similar  to  products   manufactured  by  the
Communications Software Product Group of Lucent or successor thereof. The status
of  preferred  supplier  means  that  Lucent  will  have and  will be given  the
opportunity to bid on any project of Licensee  containing  products and services
substantially  similar in quality and  functionality to CS Software Products and
Licensee shall award the project or portion thereof -if applicable- to Lucent if
the Lucent offered price for that project or the relevant portion thereof is not
more than [REDACTED] than the lowest price  offered by an  alternative  supplier
for a substantially similar solution or substantially comparable portion.

In the event Lucent, pursuant to the foregoing,  will not be awarded the project
or corresponding portion of it, then Licensee will arrange a meeting between one
or more Executive Officers of Licensee and one or more Executive Officers of the
Communications  Software  Product  Group in  order to  consult  how  Lucent  may
increase its success-rate in being awarded orders.


5.     PRICING SCHEDULE

<PAGE>


6.       PURCHASE ORDERS

All purchase orders  submitted by Licensee shall be deemed to incorporate and be
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,  unless  otherwise agreed
in  writing  by the  Parties.  No  provision  or data on any  purchase  order or
contained in any documents attached to or referenced in any purchase order shall
be binding to the extent that it is in addition to or contradicts  the terms and
conditions  contained  herein  or  the  provisions  of  the  Statement  of  Work
(including  amendments  thereto).  All other such data and  provisions  shall be
deemed  deleted  and are  hereby  rejected  except to the  extent  such data and
provisions are incorporated in an executed Change Order.  Additional  provisions
applicable  to the ordering of specific  items may be found in the other clauses
or Attachments of this Agreement.

All purchase  orders shall  contain the  information  reasonably  necessary  for
Lucent to fulfill the order.  Lucent  promptly will notify Licensee if Lucent is
unable to FULFILL a purchase order as submitted.

The Parties  recognize  that from time to time  Licensee  may desire that Lucent
provide  Services  promptly and without adhering to the ordering process set out
by the above paragraphs,  for example,  in the case of a telephonic  request for
emergency  support.  Licensee shall promptly establish a ""running order"" against
which invoices for Services performed in response to such requests can be billed
at a  reasonable  cost to be  approved  by  Licensee  (such  approval  not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) and will be paid for by Licensee.

While it is Lucent's  objective to provide  Licensee with an  acknowledgment  of
each order  received,  it is Licensee's  responsibility  to advise Lucent of any
missing or late  notifications  to insure  that the order has not been lost.  No
order is to be  considered  ""accepted""  by Lucent  unless its  receipt  has been
acknowledged (such  acknowledgement not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
however,  orders for  Services  to be billed  against a running  order  shall be
deemed accepted by Lucent if Lucent commences performance thereof.


7.      DELIVERY

Lucent will make arrangements for the delivery of Licensed  Materials ordered by
Licensee  according to the Specifications and intervals included in Appendix B -
Statement  of Work.  Licensee  will  specify  the  location  for the order to be
delivered. Delivery will be made according to the standard procedures of Lucent,
unless otherwise requested by Licensee and agreed to by Lucent in writing.


7.1     SPECIAL PACKING AND/OR MARKING

Lucent's  prices include  packing and marking  containers in accordance
with Lucent's standard  practices for shipment.  When, in order to meet
Licensee's  written request,  Lucent packs a product and/or is required
to  mark  shipping  cartons  in  accordance  with  Licensee's   written
specifications,  such shall be done by Lucent for an additional  charge
which shall be invoiced to and paid by Licensee in accordance  with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement; provided that such charges have
been agreed upon by the Parties in writing.

Lucent shall:

(a)      Render the commercial invoice;
(b)      Send full set of bill of lading, marked as to who to notify;
(c)      Render certificate of Origin or Quality;

requirements of each container,  in English,  with appropriate
illustrative marks universal in international trade;
(f)      Mark each  container  with  carton  number,  contract  number,
destination,  weights and cubes.  International shipments will
also be marked with the freight-forward  location and the port
of destination.


7.2     PASSING OF RISK AND TITLE

Title to  Licensed  Materials  shall  not pass to  Licensee,  but shall
remain  with  Lucent  or its  suppliers,  as the case may be.  Title to
hardware will pass upon delivery to Licensee's  facility.  Risk of loss
or damage to Licensed  Materials,  including any media  containing  the
Licensed  Materials,  or other items  furnished to Licensee  under this
Agreement  shall  pass to  Licensee  upon  delivery  of  said  Licensed
Materials or items to an authorized  shipping agent or upon  completion
of transmission if electronically delivered.

Nothing herein shall, during the period a Party has the risk of loss or
damage to an item,  relieve the other Party of responsibility  for loss
or  damage to the item  resulting  from the acts or  omissions  of such
other Party, its employees or agents.


8.     ACCEPTANCE

After Lucent's  installation of the Licensed  Materials,  or any part thereof as
set forth in Appendix B, Lucent will deliver a Completion Notice to Licensee and
Licensee will carry out  Acceptance  Tests in  accordance  with the Statement of
Work,  testing the  compliance of the Licensed  Materials  with the Statement of
Work  (Appendix  B).  Licensee  will  start the  Acceptance  Tests no later than
[REDACTED]  days after  Lucent's  installation  of the  Licensed  Materials  and
receipt of the Completion Notice and complete the Acceptance Tests no later than
[REDACTED]  days after  Lucent's  installation  of the  Licensed  Materials  and
receipt of the Completion Notice by Licensee.

Licensed  Materials  will be considered  fully accepted  unless Lucent  receives
written   notification  to  the  contrary   documenting  the  specific  material
non-compliance   with  the  Specifications   within  [REDACTED]  after  Lucent's
installation of such Licensed Materials and Licensee's receipt of the Completion
Notice. Lucent will promptly correct any material non-compliance for which it is
responsible  and deliver the modified  Licensed  Material.  Licensee  shall have
[REDACTED] days from the date of installation of the modified Licensed Materials
and Licensee's receipt of the Completion Notice to inspect,  test, evaluate said
modified Licensed Materials to determine whether the modified Licensed Materials
are materially  compliant with the  Specifications.  Modified Licensed Materials
will be considered fully accepted unless Lucent receives written notification to
the  contrary   documenting  the  specific  material   non-compliance  with  the
Specifications  within  [REDACTED]  days  after  Lucent's  installation  of such
modified  Licensed  Materials and Licensee's  receipt of the Completion  Notice.
This process  shall be repeated  until the  Licensed  Materials  are  considered
accepted per this section.

Notwithstanding  anything in this  Agreement to the contrary,  Licensee's Use of
any part of the Licensed  Materials for any purpose  other than testing,  or any
other Use  conducted at Lucent's  direction or under  Lucent's  supervision,  as
provided  for above or  training,  whether or not  revenue is  generated,  shall
constitute Acceptance for all relevant purposes of this Agreement, including but
not limited to, commencement of the applicable warranty period.

The costs and expenses of the  Acceptance Tests will be borne by Licensee.  Upon
request of Licensee,  Lucent will provide  reasonable support to Licensee during

9.    INVOICES AND TERMS OF PAYMENT

Lucent will forward invoices in Lucent's  standard format or as otherwise agreed
in writing by the Parties to Licensee upon shipment of the Licensed Materials or
portion  thereof.  Lucent will forward  invoices for Services upon completion of
the Services or portion  thereof  described in the invoice or as soon thereafter
as  practicable.  Licensee will pay said invoices as set out below.  If Licensee
requires  special  information on the invoice or that it be in a special format,
then Licensee shall pay Lucent for additional  charges associated with complying
with Licensee's special needs provided that the charges have been agreed upon by
the Parties in writing.

Licensee  shall pay each invoice for Licensed  Materials or Third Party Products
within  [REDACTED]  days from the date of the invoice.  Licensee  shall pay each
invoice for Services  within the later of (i)  [REDACTED]  days from the date of
the  invoice  or  (ii)  [REDACTED]  business  days  from  acceptance  or  deemed
acceptance by Licensee of that portion of the work or the Licensed  Materials to
which the Services  relate.  Such invoice shall not be subject to withholding or
reduction  for any  reason,  except as  provided  for in this  clause.  All bank
charges,  taxes,  levies  and other  costs  which  may be due or  become  due on
transfers of payments shall be for the account of Licensee.

If Licensee disputes any item contained on the invoice,  then Licensee shall pay
all undisputed  amounts to Lucent and notify Lucent of the disputed items within
the [REDACTED]  days of receipt of the invoice.  Upon resolution of the disputed
amount, which shall occur within [REDACTED] days, Licensee shall pay in full all
amounts due to Lucent.  If  Licensee  is unable to document a claim  against the
invoiced item, the original  invoice date plus [REDACTED] days will be the basis
for calculating late payment penalties set forth below.  Delinquent payments and
disputed payments where the dispute is resolved in favor of Lucent,  are subject
to a late  payment  charge  equal to the  lesser of (i)  [REDACTED]  or (ii) the
maximum amount allowed by law.

If an undisputed  invoice  remains unpaid for  [REDACTED]  days after payment is
due,  Licensee shall be in default of its obligations  under the Agreement,  and
Lucent may terminate this Agreement;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that Lucent will have
provided  [REDACTED]  Days prior written  notice to Licensee,  and Licensee will
have failed to pay all monies due,  including late payment charges by the end of
such  [REDACTED]  Day  period.  If Lucent  elects to  terminate  this  Agreement
pursuant to this paragraph, Lucent may, without prejudice to any other rights or
remedies of Lucent in this  Agreement  or at law or in equity  suspend all work,
and Licensee  shall  return to Lucent (or destroy in  accordance  with  Lucent's
written  instructions)  such  portion  of  Lucent's  products  and all copies of
Licensed  Materials  at all Licensee  locations  for which  payment  (including,
without limitation, license fees) has not been received. Licensee shall bear the
expense  of removal of  Lucent's  products  and  Licensed  Materials.  All costs
associated  with restoring  Licensee's  premises to  pre-installation  condition
shall be the sole responsibility of Licensee.  Licensee shall pay all documented
damages,  costs and expenses  (including,  without limitation,  reasonable legal
fees) incurred by Lucent in termination of this Agreement.


10.    TAXES & LEVIES

Licensee shall be liable for and shall reimburse  Lucent for all taxes,  duties,
levies and related  charges  (including  any  interest and  penalties),  however
designated (excluding taxes on Lucent's net income) imposed upon or arising from
the provision of Services,  or the transfer,  sale,  license, or use of Licensed
Materials  or other items  provided  by Lucent.  Taxes  reimbursable  under this
clause shall be separately listed on the invoice.


11
<PAGE>


Lucent shall not collect the otherwise  applicable tax if Licensee's purchase is
exempt  from  Lucent's  collection  of  such  tax  and  a  valid  tax  exemption
certificate is furnished by Licensee to Lucent.

Lucent  reserves  the right to claim  United  States  or  foreign  customs  duty
drawback  on all  sales  pursuant  to this  Agreement.  The  Parties  agrees  to
cooperate  with each other in this  regard in all  reasonable  ways,  including,
without   limitation,   providing  proof  of  exportation,   advance  notice  of
exportation, certificates,  endorsements, or any other documentation or proof as
may be necessary for Lucent or its Affiliates to receive payment of the drawback
claims and, if required by the United States Customs  Service or similar entity,
by making the  Licensed  Materials  available  for  examination  by such Customs
Service or entity.


11.    EXPORT CONTROL

The Parties  acknowledge that any License Materials and Information  (including,
but not limited to, Services and training)  provided under this Agreement may be
subject to U.S.  export  laws and  regulations,  and any use or transfer of such
Licensed  Materials and Information must be authorized under those  regulations.
Licensee  agrees not to use,  distribute,  transfer,  or transmit  the  Licensed
Materials or Information (even if incorporated into other products) in violation
of U.S. export  regulations.  If reasonably  requested by Lucent,  Licensee also
agrees to sign written assurances and other  export-related  documents as may be
required for Lucent to comply with U.S.
export regulations.


12.    APPLICABLE LICENSES

Upon delivery of Licensed Materials  pursuant to this Agreement,  and subject to
Licensee's  payment of the applicable  fees and  compliance  with the applicable
terms and conditions hereunder, Lucent grants to Licensee a perpetual, personal,
nontransferable,  and nonexclusive  license with use limitations to Use Licensed
Materials on the Designated Processors for its own business operations. Licensee
is  authorized  to Use  Licensed  Materials  within  a  capacity  limitation  to
interface with such network  elements at such capacity levels within  Licensee's

license fees prior to exceeding the authorized  capacity  limitation.  Except as
provided  in the  following  paragraph,  no license is  granted to  Licensee  to
sublicense  such  Licensed  Materials  furnished by Lucent.  Licensee  shall not
reverse engineer,  decompile or disassemble Software furnished as object code to
generate  corresponding  Source  Code.  Unless  otherwise  agreed in  writing by
Lucent,  Licensee  shall not modify  Software  furnished  by  Lucent  under this
Agreement  except as provided in the Related  Documentation.  If the  Designated
Processor becomes temporarily inoperative,  Licensee shall have the right to Use
the Licensed  Materials  temporarily on a backup processor until operable status
is restored and processing on the backup processor is completed.


12
<PAGE>


Lucent  grants  to  Licensee  a  non-exclusive  and  non-transferable  right  to
sublicense  the Licensed  Materials  to a  wholly-owned  Subsidiary  on a single
Designated Processor; provided, however, as follows:

(i)      Such  Subsidiary  is  bound  in  writing  by the  same  terms,
conditions and  restrictions  as contained in this  Agreement,
but shall have no right to grant future sublicenses.

(ii)     Licensee shall remain fully liable for the  performance by the
Subsidiary of all terms of the sublicense.

(iii)    Licensee  shall use best  efforts to enforce  Lucent's  rights
under such  sublicense  agreement and shall do such things and
provide  Lucent with such  assistance  as may be necessary for
Lucent to enforce such rights.


12.1     TITLE, RESTRICTIONS AND CONFIDENTIALITY OF LICENSED MATERIALS

All Licensed Materials  (whether or not part of Firmware)  furnished by
Lucent,   and  all  copies   thereof   made  by   Licensee,   including
translations,  compilations,  and partial copies are, and shall remain,
the property of Lucent.  Except for any part of such Licensed Materials
which is or  becomes  generally  known to the public  through  acts not
attributable to Licensee,  Licensee shall hold such Licensed  Materials
in confidence,  and shall not,  without Lucent's prior written consent,
disclose,  provide,  or otherwise make available,  in whole or in part,
any Licensed  Materials  to anyone,  except to its  employees  having a
need-to-know in connection  with licensed Use.  Licensee shall not make
any copies of any  Licensed  Materials  except as necessary to exercise
the rights granted hereunder.  Licensee shall reproduce and include any
Lucent copyright and proprietary notice on all such necessary copies of
Licensed Materials.  Licensee shall also mark all media containing such
copies  with  a  warning  that   Licensed   Materials  are  subject  to
restrictions  contained in an agreement between Lucent and Licensee and
that they are the property of Lucent.  Licensee shall maintain  records
of the number and  location  of all copies of  Licensed  Materials.  If
Licensee's  license is canceled  or  terminated,  or when the  Licensed
Materials are no longer  needed by Licensee in  Licensee's  discretion,
Licensee  shall return all copies of such Licensed  Materials to Lucent
or follow written disposition instructions provided by Lucent.


12.2 MODIFICATIONS TO USER CONTROLLED MODULES

Licensee may add to,  delete from, or modify user  controlled  Software
modules or menus as  contemplated  in the Related  Documentation.  Such
changes or modifications,  however extensive, shall not affect Lucent's
title to the Licensed  Materials.  Licensee  shall retain  ownership to
intellectual property independently developed by Licensee. Lucent shall
have no  liability  for  Licensee's  errors in making  such  changes or
modifications.


12.3 CHANGES IN LICENSED MATERIALS

Prior to shipment,  Lucent at its option may, upon prior written notice
to  Licensee  and with  Licensee's  prior  written  consent,  not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, modify the Specifications relating to


13
<PAGE>


its Licensed  Materials,  provided the modifications,  under normal and
proper Use, do not materially  adversely affect the Use,  function,  or
performance of the ordered Licensed Materials.  Unless otherwise agreed
in  writing,  such  substitution  shall not  result  in any  additional
charges to  Licensee  with  respect to  licenses  for which  Lucent has
quoted fees to Licensee.


12.4 OPTIONAL SOFTWARE FEATURES

Software provided to Licensee under this Agreement may contain optional
features which are separately licensed and priced. Licensee agrees that
such  optional  features  will not  knowingly  be activated by Licensee
without  written  authorization  from Lucent and Licensee's  payment of
appropriate  license fees. If such features are activated  knowingly by
Licensee,  Licensee  agrees to so  notify  Lucent  promptly  and to pay
Lucent the  license  fees for the  activated  features,  as well as the
reasonable  cost of money for the  period in which such  features  were
activated.  In the  event  that such  features  are  activated  without
Licensee's  knowledge  in spite of  Licensee's  reasonable  efforts  to
comply with this restriction,  Licensee agrees to cooperate with Lucent
to  deactivate  such  features and prevent  future  activation  of such
features.


12.5 RELOCATION OF LICENSED MATERIALS

Upon [REDACTED] days advance written notice, Licensee may move Software
contained in the Licensed  Materials or optional  feature  packages for
which  Licensee has the right to Use,  from a Designated  Processor and
relocate them to another  Designated  Processor within the same company
as  Licensee.  Unless  otherwise  agreed  by the  parties  in  writing,
Licensee shall not be required to pay additional right-to-use fees as a
result of such  relocation,  except  where size  sensitive  units are a
factor or where use of the  Software  is for a different  purpose  than
originally specified. Lucent may charge Licensee for Services requested
by Licensee in support of such  relocation.  Licensee  shall remove all
copies of the Software from any  processor  from which the Software has
been  relocated.  To the extent that Lucent  otherwise  consents to the
relocation  of a Designated  Processor  outside of the United States or
the United  Kingdom,  Lucent and  Licensee  agree to  negotiate in good
faith an amendment to the geographic territories covered by Section 15.
The Parties acknowledge that such an amendment, if agreed, may increase
costs to Licensee.


12.6 CANCELLATION OF LICENSE

Notwithstanding any other clause in this Agreement to the contrary,  if
Licensee  materially  breaches any of the terms and  conditions of this
Agreement with respect to the unauthorized  Use, transfer or sublicense
of Licensed  Materials,  and such  failure  continues beyond [REDACTED]
days after receipt of written notice thereof by Licensee,  Lucent, upon
written  notice to  Licensee,  may, in  addition to any other  remedies
hereunder,  cancel the license  granted  hereunder  for the  applicable
portion of the Licensed  Materials  affected by the  unauthorized  Use,
transfer  or  sublicense.  Cancellation  of license  shall not  relieve
Licensee of its  obligation  to pay all the fees that have  accrued for
Use of the Licensed Materials.

(c)      The foregoing  sets forth an additional  warranty for Lucent's
products and Software.  The failure of the Licensed  Materials
to meet the foregoing  requirements during the warranty period
set forth in this  subsection  13.2  entitles  Licensee to the
remedies set forth elsewhere in this Section 13.

(d)      Other  than as set forth in  Section  13.2(b),  nothing in the
foregoing  shall be deemed to make Lucent  responsible for the
Year   2000   capability   of   any   third   party   Software
interoperating  or  intending  to  operate  with the  Licensed
Materials.


13.3     NO ADDITIONAL WARRANTIES

THE  FOREGOING  WARRANTIES  ARE  EXCLUSIVE AND ARE IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER
EXPRESS AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES
OF  MERCHANTABILITY  AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR  PURPOSE.  LICENSEE'S
SOLE AND  EXCLUSIVE  REMEDY  SHALL BE  LUCENT'S  OBLIGATION  TO REPAIR,
REPLACE,  CREDIT, OR REFUND AS SET FORTH ABOVE.  LICENSEE'S SOLE REMEDY
FOR  INFRINGEMENT   SHALL  BE  THE  REMEDIES  SET  FORTH  IN  ""PATENTS,
TRADEMARKS & COPYRIGHTS"" HEREIN.


13.4 POST-WARRANTY SUPPORT

Post-warranty  support  will be  provided on terms and  conditions  and
subject to such fees as contained in a separate  maintenance  agreement
attached hereto


14.     USE OF INFORMATION

All technical and business  information in whatever form which bears a legend or
notice  restricting  its use,  copying or  dissemination  or, if not in tangible


16
<PAGE>


form,  is  described  as  being  proprietary  or  confidential  at the  time  of
disclosure and is subsequently  summarized in writing so marked and delivered to
the receiving Party within thirty (30) days of disclosure to the receiving Party
(all  hereinafter  designated  ""Information"")  shall  remain the property of the
furnishing  Party. All Software shall be deemed to be Information  regardless of
how labeled.  The furnishing  Party grants the receiving  Party the right to use
such Information only as follows:  Such Information (a) shall not be  reproduced
or copied, in whole or part, except for use as authorized in this Agreement; and
(b) shall,  together  with any full or partial  copies  thereof,  be returned or
destroyed when no longer needed. Licensee shall use such Information only (a) to
order, (b) to evaluate the Licensed Materials,  or other items, or Services,  or
(c) to install,  operate,  and maintain the particular  Licensed  Materials,  or
other items for which it was originally  furnished.  Unless the furnishing Party
consents in writing,  such  Information,  except for that part, if any, which is
known to the receiving Party to be free of any confidential obligation, or which
becomes  generally  known to the public  through  acts not  attributable  to the
receiving  Party,  shall  be held in  confidence  by the  receiving  Party.  The
receiving  Party  may  disclose  such  Information  to other  persons,  upon the
furnishing Party's prior written authorization,  but solely to enable such third
party to perform acts which this clause expressly authorizes the receiving Party
to perform  itself and further  provided  such other person agrees in writing (a
copy of which writing will be provided to the  furnishing  Party at its request)
to the same  conditions  respecting use of Information  contained in this clause
and to any other reasonable conditions requested by the furnishing Party.


15.     PATENTS, TRADEMARKS & COPYRIGHTS

In the event of any claim,  action,  proceeding or suit by a third party against
Licensee alleging an infringement of any United States or United Kingdom patent,
copyright,  or trademark,  or a violation in the United States or United Kingdom
of any trade secret or  proprietary  rights by reason of the use, in  accordance
with Lucent's or other applicable specifications,  any of the Licensed Materials
or other item furnished by Lucent to Licensee under this Agreement,  Lucent,  at
its expense,  will defend  Licensee,  subject to the  conditions  and exceptions
stated  below.  Lucent will  reimburse  Licensee  for any  losses,  liabilities,
claims,  actions,  cost, expense or attorney's fee, incurred at Lucent's written
request or  authorization,  and will  indemnify  Licensee  against any liability
assessed against  Licensee by final judgment on account of such  infringement or
violation arising out of such use.

If Licensee's use shall be enjoined or in Lucent's  reasonable opinion is likely
to be  enjoined,  Lucent  will,  at its expense  and at its  option,  either (a)
replace the affected  portion of the Licensed  Materials or other item furnished
pursuant to this Agreement with a suitable  substitute free of any  infringement
or  violation,  (b)  modify  it so that it will be free of the  infringement  or
violation,  or (c) procure  for  Licensee a license or other right to use it. If
none of the foregoing  options is  practical,  Lucent will give Licensee as much
notice  as  possible  and then  remove  the  enjoined  portion  of the  Licensed
Materials  or other  item,  or in the event  that  removal  of a portion  is not
commercially reasonable, such greater portion of the Licensed Materials or items
that is  commercially  reasonable,  and refund to Licensee a PRO RATA portion of
the license right to use fees paid to Lucent under this  Agreement  equal to the
remaining  useful  life of the  Licensed  Materials,  which  useful life will be
deemed to be ten (10) years from the date of delivery of the Licensed Materials.

Licensee shall give Lucent prompt  written  notice of all such claims,  actions,
proceedings  or suits alleging  infringement  or violation and Lucent shall have
full and  complete  authority  to assume  the sole  defense  thereof,  including
appeals,  and to settle  same.  Licensee  shall,  upon  Lucent's  request and at
Lucent's expense, furnish  all necessary information and assistance available to
Licensee and cooperate in every  reasonable way to facilitate the defense and/or


17
<PAGE>


settlement of any such claim, action, proceeding or suit at Lucent's expense. If
Lucent  fails or refuses to provide  the defense of Licensee as required by this
Section 15,  Licensee  shall be entitled to proceed  with its own defense at the
expense  of  Lucent.  Lucent  shall be  entitled  to  proceed  with a defense of
Licensee with a reservation of rights.

No  undertaking  of Lucent under this  section  shall extend to any such alleged
infringement  or violation  to the extent that it: (a) arises from  adherence to
design modifications,  specifications, drawings, or express written instructions
which  Lucent is  expressly  directed by  Licensee  to follow,  but only if such
alleged  infringement or violation does not reside in  corresponding  commercial
Licensed Material of Lucent's design or selection;  or (b) arises from adherence
to  instructions  to apply  Licensee's  trademark,  trade name, or other company
identification;  or (c) resides in a Licensed  Material which is not of Lucent's
origin  and  which is  furnished  by  Licensee  to  Lucent  for use  under  this
Agreement;  or (d) relates to use of Licensed  Materials or other items provided
by Lucent in  combinations  with other  products,  Licensed  Materials  or other
items,  furnished  either  by  Lucent  or  others,  which  combination  was  not
installed, recommended or otherwise approved by Lucent.

THE  LIABILITY  OF LUCENT  AND  LICENSEE  WITH  RESPECT  TO ANY AND ALL  CLAIMS,
ACTIONS,  PROCEEDINGS,  OR SUITS  BY  THIRD  PARTIES  ALLEGING  INFRINGEMENT  OF
PATENTS,  TRADEMARKS, OR COPYRIGHTS OR VIOLATION OF TRADE SECRETS OR PROPRIETARY
RIGHTS BECAUSE OF, OR IN CONNECTION  WITH, ANY ITEMS FURNISHED  PURSUANT TO THIS
AGREEMENT  SHALL BE  LIMITED TO THE  SPECIFIC  UNDERTAKINGS  CONTAINED  IN  THIS
SECTION.

16.      LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY

[REDACTED]

18
<PAGE>


17.     FORCE MAJEURE

Neither Party shall be liable to the other Party for any loss, damage,  delay or
failure of performance  resulting directly or indirectly from any cause which is
beyond its  reasonable  control,  including,  but not  limited to the  elements;
extraordinary  traffic conditions;  riots; civil  disturbances;  wars; states of
belligerency  or  acts  of the  public  enemy;  labor  disputes;  strikes;  work
stoppages;   inability  to  secure  raw  materials,  product  or  transportation
facilities; or the laws, regulations, acts or failure to act of any governmental
authority,  including  but not  limited  to  denial  of a U.S.  Export  License,
hereinafter  referred to as ""Force  Majeure"".  A Party shall promptly notify the
other Party of the  occurrence of a Force Majeure event and the notifying  Party
shall be excused from any further  performance of these obligations  affected by
the Force Majeure  Event for as long as such Force  Majeure Event  continues and
such Party uses and continues to use its best efforts to recommence performance.
Failure of a Party to perform under this Agreement because of the endurance of a
Force Majeure event for more than thirty (30) days will represent grounds by the
other Party to  terminate  the portion of this  Agreement  affected by the Force
Majeure event.


18.      INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR

All work  performed by one Party under this  Agreement  shall be performed as an
independent  contractor and not as an agent of the other and neither Party shall
be, nor represent itself to be, the employee, agent, representative,  partner or
joint  venture of the other.  Neither Party shall have the right or authority to
assume or create  an  obligation  on behalf of or in the name of the other or to
otherwise act on behalf of the other.  The performing Party shall be responsible
for its employees' and agents'  compliance with all applicable laws,  rules, and
regulations while performing work under this Agreement.


19.     ASSIGNMENT

Except as provided in this Agreement,  neither Party shall assign this Agreement
or any  right  or  interest  under  this  Agreement,  nor  delegate  any work or


19
<PAGE>


obligation to be performed under this Agreement,  (an ""assignment"")  without the
other Party's prior written consent.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  Lucent may
assign or delegate any portion of this  Agreement that relates to work performed
in the European Union to an affiliate  entity  domiciled in the European  Union;
provided,  however,  that Lucent shall remain responsible for the performance by
the assignee of such obligations.  Nothing shall preclude a Party from employing
a  subcontractor  in carrying out its obligations  under this  Agreement,  but a
Party's  use of  such  subcontractor  shall  not  release  the  Party  from  its
obligations under this Agreement.

20.     NON-WAIVER

No waiver of the terms and  conditions  of this  Agreement,  or the  failure  of
either Party to strictly  enforce any term or condition of this Agreement on one
or more  occasions  shall be  construed  as a waiver of the same or of any other
term or condition of this Agreement on any other occasion.


21.     SEVERABILITY

If any provision in this Agreement, or any portion thereof, is subsequently held
to be invalid or unenforceable under any applicable statute or rule of law, then
that provision or portion  notwithstanding,  this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and such  provision or portion shall be deemed omitted and this
Agreement  shall be construed as if such invalid or  unenforceable  provision or
portion had not been contained herein.

22.     SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES

Senior  Management of either Party may, upon notice of a dispute and within five
(5)  business  days of receipt of such a notice  from the other  Party  elect to
utilize a non-binding resolution procedure whereby each presents its case before
a panel consisting of two senior  executives of each of the Parties and, if such
executives  can agree upon such an  individual,  a mutually  acceptable  neutral
advisor.  If a Party elects to use the procedure  set forth in this clause,  the
other Party shall participate.  The hearing shall occur no more than 10 business
days after a Party serves  notice to use the procedure set forth in this clause.
If the matter cannot be resolved by such senior executives, the neutral advisor,
if one has been agreed upon,  may be asked to assist such senior  executives  in
evaluating the strengths and  weaknesses of each Party's  position on the merits
of their dispute. The Parties shall each bear their respective costs incurred in
connection  with the procedure set forth in this clause,  except that they shall
share equally the fees and expenses of the neutral advisor, if any, and the cost
of the facility for the hearing.

If a dispute is not  resolved as set forth above,  then either  Party may,  upon
notice  to the other  Party,  submit  the  dispute  to  binding  arbitration  in
accordance with the following:

(a)      The arbitration  shall be held in New York City before a panel
of three  arbitrators.  Either  Party may,  upon notice to the
other Party,  demand arbitration by serving on the other Party
a statement of the dispute,  the facts relating or giving rise
to such dispute and the name of the arbitrator selected by it.
Issues of arbitration shall be decided by the arbitrators.

(b)      Within five (5) days after  receipt of such notice,  the other
Party shall name its arbitrator, and the two arbitrators named
by the Parties shall,  within five (5) days  after the date of
such notice, select the third arbitrator.

(c)      The   arbitration   shall  be  administered  by  the  American
Arbitration  Association  and be  governed  by the  Commercial


20
<PAGE>


Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association,  as
may be amended from time to time, except as expressly provided
in this clause. The arbitrators may not amend or disregard any
provision of this clause.

(d)      Discovery shall only be allowed as ordered by the arbitrators.
The  arbitrators  shall allow such discovery as is appropriate
to the purposes of arbitration in accomplishing a fair, speedy
and  cost-effective  resolution of disputes.  The  arbitrators
shall  reference the rules of evidence of the Federal Rules of
Civil  Procedure  then in  effect  in  setting  the  scope and
direction  of such  discovery,  but shall  afford  substantial
weight  to  the   burden   of   discovery   in   making   such
determinations.

(e)      The decision and award  rendered by the  arbitrators  shall be
binding  on  the  Parties.   The  arbitrators  shall  have  no
authority to award  punitive or exemplary  damages or to award
damages in excess or in contravention of the Agreement.

(f)      The  arbitration  shall  be  governed  by  the  United  States
Arbitration  Act.  The  award  shall be made  within  four (4)
months of the  appointment  of the  arbitrator and judgment on
the award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction.

(g)      The costs of the arbitration proceedings conducted pursuant to
this  clause  shall  be paid by the  Party  designated  by the
arbitrators.


23.      TERMINATION; SURVIVAL OF OBLIGATIONS

In the event that either Party is in material  breach or default of the terms of
this Agreement and such breach or default  continues for a period of thirty (30)
days after receipt of written notice from the other Party, then the Party not in
breach or default shall have the right to terminate this  Agreement  without any
charge , obligation or liability except for (i) charges to Licensee for Software
Products  already  delivered and accepted or deemed accepted and (ii) charges to
Licensee for Services already performed.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  if the
non-breaching party is Licensee,  Licensee may, at its option and in addition to
the remedies provided in Section 8A , return all Software Products to Lucent and
receive a refund from  Lucent for the amounts  paid to Lucent in clauses (i) and
(ii) above. The Party not in breach or default shall provide full cooperation to
the other party in every  reasonable  way to facilitate the remedy of the breach
or default  hereunder  within the applicable  cure period.  Notwithstanding  the
foregoing,  if the nature of the  material  breach or default is such that it is
not a  payment  obligation  (other  than  failure  to  comply  with the  license
restrictions  contained herein) and it is incapable of cure within the foregoing
thirty (30) day period, then the thirty (30) day cure period may be extended for
a  reasonable  period of time (in no event to exceed an  additional  thirty (30)
days), provided that the Party in breach or default is proceeding diligently and
in good faith to effectuate a cure.

The Parties  agree,  in good faith to negotiate  and  finalize  the  maintenance
agreement  (the  ""Maintenance  Agreement""),  as  referred  to in the letter from
Lucent dated  October 21, 1998,  within a period of fifteen (15)  business  days
following the Effective  Date.  The  Maintenance  Agreement will be based on the
pricing and other  principles as stated in the above referred to letter.  In the
event no  agreement  is  reached  within  said  time  frame  with  respect  to a
maintenance agreement, either party will have the right to immediately terminate
this Agreement with no additional obligations.

The Parties'  rights and  obligations  which,  by their nature,  would  continue
beyond the termination, cancellation, or expiration of this Agreement, including


21
<PAGE>


but not  limited to, the  obligations  in the clauses  entitled  Limitations  of
Liability,  Patents, Trademarks and Copyrights, Use of Information,  Publication
of Agreement, and Export Control, shall survive such termination,  cancellation,
or expiration.


24.     GOVERNING LAW

Except as required by local law in any jurisdiction outside of the United States
and as expressly  agreed to in writing by the Parties,  this  Agreement  and the
rights and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement shall be construed in
accordance  with and be  governed  by the laws of the State of New York  without
giving effect to the principles therein relating to the conflicts of law.


25.      NOTICES

All notices,  requests,  approvals and other communications (""Notices"") required
or allowed under this  Agreement  shall be in writing and addressed as set forth
below or to such other person  and/or  address as either Party may  designate by
written Notice pursuant hereto.  Such Notices shall be deemed to have been given
when received.  Notices may be delivered by hand or sent by prepaid certified or

also forwarded by prepaid registered airmail.

Dear Frank,

This letter refers to our discussions of last Friday  (98/10/16) with respect to
changes to the scope of work of our project,  and is intended to synchronize our
presently negotiated SOW (Version 3.0 DRAFT 3) to the total price of the project
and the license agreement we are currently negotiating.  Secondly, we also refer
to the  discussions of last Friday  regarding  VIATEL's  request for maintenance
services. Thirdly, we would like to bring up a subject not previously discussed,
which is a recent  change to the number of switches in your  described  network,
that is now  included  in the  above  referenced  SOW and for which you have not
approved pricing.

Definition of 'no-breakage' support:
No-breakage support means:
a)       During the term of this maintenance agreement Lucent agrees to maintain
the compatibility  between the Software on the one hand, and the NORTEL
DMS systems  100E,  250/300,  and GSP on the other hand,  provided that
VIATEL  has  made   available  to  Lucent  well  in  advance  all  such
information (which may include Proprietary Information), subject to the
use and  disclosure  restrictions  of  this  Agreement,  as  reasonably
required to establish such compatibility.
b)       If VIATEL determines,  upon analysis  undertaken,  that there have been
any changes to its NORTEL DMS systems 100E, 250, 300, and GSP installed
in its network that would  affect the  compatibility  or the  operating
ability with Lucent's product or successor  product,  then VIATEL shall
promptly  provide to Lucent  the  information  necessary  for Lucent to
update the compatibility of its products or successor products.
c)       Compatibility  as  referred  to in sub a) and  sub b)  means  that  the
functionality  of  Lucent  products  will  not  be  affected.  However,
compatibility does not mean, and Lucent does not warrant,  that the new
functionality  of the new  generic  release of the NORTEL DMS  software
will work in conjunction with and is supported by the Lucent product.

[REDACTED]

Please provide us with written confirmation on acceptance of this letter.

Sincerely

Angela R. Pinette

6    Proprietary Information

The parties anticipate that during the term of this Agreement, it may be necessary for either party to transfer to the other party information of a proprietary nature. Each of the parties agrees that it will use the
same reasonable efforts to protect the other’s Proprietary Information as are used to protect its own but will at least use reasonable care. Disclosures of such information shall be restricted to those individuals who are directly participating
in the JTRS or the MUOS programs and contract efforts identified herein, who have a need to know such information, and who have been made aware of and consent to abide by the restrictions herein concerning the use of such information.

Neither party shall make any reproduction, disclosure, nor use of such Proprietary
Information except as may be required in the performance of this Agreement.

The obligation to protect Proprietary Information, and the liability for unauthorized disclosure or use of Proprietary Information, shall not apply with respect to such information which is now available or becomes available to the public
without breach of this Agreement; information lawfully received without restrictions from other sources, including the U.S. Government; information known to the Receiving Party prior to disclosure; information published or disclosed by the
Disclosing Party to others, including the U.S. Government, without restriction; information developed by the Receiving Party independent of and without use of the information disclosed by the Disclosing Party; or, information for which further use
or disclosure by the Receiving Party is authorized in writing by the Disclosing Party.


10








The obligations and provisions of this provision shall survive the expiration and termination of the other portions of
this Agreement for a period of [**] from the date hereof. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement each party will, upon request, return all Proprietary Information received from the other party and copies made thereof by the Receiving Party
under this Agreement, or certify by written memorandum that all such Proprietary Information has been destroyed except that each party may retain an archival copy to be used only in case of a dispute concerning this Agreement.

Each party warrants that it has the right to disclose the Proprietary Information disclosed
to the other party hereunder for the purpose set out in this Agreement.

Except
as expressly provided herein neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, nor the furnishing of any Proprietary Information shall be construed as granting either expressly or by implication, estoppel or otherwise, any license under any
invention, improvement, discovery or patent now or hereafter owned or controlled by a party disclosing Proprietary Information hereunder.

If either Party should be required by law or regulation, or receive a subpoena, court order or other governmental order that compels such Party to disclose Proprietary
Information of the other Party, it shall promptly notify the Disclosing Party so the latter may take necessary steps to prevent or limit disclosure. In any event, the Receiving Party shall disclose only so much of the Disclosing Party’s
Proprietary Information as is required by law.

7    Limitations on Usage of Licensee Furnished Items

Licensee furnished items are defined to be any software, firmware, hardware, systems, or documentation, provided by Licensee to Licensor. Licensor shall not reverse engineer Licensee furnished items. Upon completion
of the effort under the attached SOW, or upon request by Licensee, whichever occurs first, the Licensor shall return all Licensee furnished items to Licensee, unless otherwise specified by Licensee in writing or in the requirements of the SOW.


8    Quality Assurance/Configuration
Management/Safety Requirements

safety requirements that may be subsequently required under this Agreement after the Effective Date. Any resulting safety requirements will be negotiated in good faith and accepted in writing by the Parties, but will be included within the scope of
this Agreement.

9    Malicious Software or Systems

The Licensor shall determine that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, the software and
systems provided do not contain any malicious code, program, or other internal component (e.g., computer virus) which could damage, destroy, or alter software, firmware, or hardware or which could reveal any data or other information accessed
through or processed by the software or systems. Further, the Licensor shall immediately inform Licensee upon reasonable suspicion that any software or systems provided hereunder may cause the harm described above.

10    Force Majeure

A Party shall be excused for nonperformance under this Agreement, for such period of time as
the cause of non-performance continues to exist, if the failure to perform arises, in whole or in part, out of causes beyond the control and without the negligence of the Party. Such causes may include, but are not restricted to (a) acts of God or
of the public enemy, (b) acts of the Government in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, (c) fires, (d) floods, (e) epidemics, (f) quarantine restrictions, (g) strikes, (h) freight embargoes and (i) unusually severe weather. If the delay is
caused by a delay of Licensor and if such delay arises out of causes beyond the reasonable control of both, and without the negligence of either, Licensor shall be excused from nonperformance unless the goods to be furnished by the Licensor were
obtainable from other sources at substantially the same cost in sufficient time to permit Licensor to meet the required delivery schedules. Licensor shall notify Licensee in writing within ten (10) calendar days after the beginning of any such
cause.

11    Governing Law and Venue


This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware. No consideration shall be given to Delaware’s conflict of laws rules. To the extent not provided for in Section 12, the Parties agree and consent to exclusive venue and jurisdiction in the state and federal courts
located in Delaware for all controversies and disputes arising under or in any way relating to this Agreement.

12    Disputes

(a)    Any dispute between the Parties shall be settled in the following manner: Licensee and Licensor agree to enter into a negotiation to resolve any dispute. Both parties agree to negotiate in good faith to reach a
mutually agreeable settlement within a reasonable amount of time. Each Party will appoint a senior management representative who does not devote substantially all of his or her time to performance under this Agreement. The representatives will
furnish to each other all non-privileged information with respect to the dispute that the Parties believe to be appropriate and germane. The representatives will negotiate in an effort to resolve the dispute without the necessity of any formal
proceeding. [**]

(b)    [**] Either Party will have the
right to apply at any time to a judicial authority for appropriate injunctive or other interim or provisional relief [**]


** Material has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission.

13    Injunctive Relief

The Parties agree to the confidentiality provisions contained in Section 6, above, and acknowledge that the unauthorized disclosure of any
information required to be kept confidential pursuant to this Agreement may give rise to immediate irreparable injury to the Party that owns the information. Notwithstanding the dispute resolution provision contained herein, each Party may obtain
immediate and injunctive relief against the breach or threatened breach by the other Party of the covenants to keep such information confidential. The Parties further agree that the covenants contained herein are reasonably necessary for the
protection of legitimate business interests of the Parties and are reasonable in scope and content.

14    Severability

In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law or be so held by applicable court decision, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render this Agreement unenforceable or
invalid as a whole, and, in such event, such provision shall be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such unenforceable or invalid provision within the limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions.


15    Export/Security Regulations

Licensee agrees that it will not in any form export, re-export, ship, or divert or cause to
be diverted, directly or indirectly, the Licensed Software to any country for which the United States Government, any agency thereof, or any other sovereign Government, at the time of export or reexport, requires an export license or other
governmental approval without first obtaining such license or approval. Furthermore, Licensor understands that the majority of MUOS Technical Information and Technical Services are subject to U.S. Government export control laws and regulations.
Therefore, Licensor shall be responsible for compliance with all applicable U.S. export control laws and regulations including the requirements of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and the Export Administration Regulations (EAR).
Licensor agrees that, except as allowed under applicable U.S. laws and regulations, no export controlled item, data, or service, furnished to it on or produced by it for the MUOS Program will be disclosed to any foreign person, business, or country,
including foreign persons employed by or associated with, or under contract with the Licensor, without the authority of an export license, agreement or applicable license exemption. In the event the Licensor or any sub tier supplier needs to
disclose MUOS export-controlled items, data or services to foreign persons, the Licensor shall be responsible (i) for obtaining, and ensuring its sub tier supplier obtains, all necessary approvals from the Government and any required export license,
agreement or applicable license exemption and (ii) for compliance with the terms of the export license, agreement or exemption. Licensor shall first notify and obtain the written consent of Licensee prior to it or its sub tier supplier submitting
any request for authority to export MUOS technical data or services. Licensor is responsible for including export control requirements in sub tier supplier agreements, and for ensuring that the suppliers are capable of complying with all applicable
U.S. Government export control laws and regulations.

Licensor is responsible
for maintaining an effective export/import compliance program that ensures compliance to government export control laws and regulations. Licensor is responsible for maintenance of proper policies and procedures, personnel training, and marking of
documents, as appropriate, in accordance with such export/import compliance program.

If required by Licensee, Licensor agrees to implement security requirements mandated by the U.S. Government issued via a DD-254 to Lockheed Martin’s contract and subsequently flowed down to



13









Licensee’s contract. If Licensor is unable to implement or follow such requirements, the Parties will negotiate in good faith to resolve such issue or
issues.

16    Records, Audit Rights


At all times during the term of this Agreement and for [**] following the
termination of this Agreement, Licensee will maintain at its principal place of business accurate records relating to its licensing obligations under this Agreement.

17    Point of Contact Designation

The Licensor shall designate to Licensee, in writing, a representative to serve as point of contact for the Licensor with Licensee or the
Government.

18    Guidelines on Nationality


Licensor further understands that Licensee is a defense contractor
providing work for the United States Government, and as such, is under certain mandatory security obligations with regard to access to its facilities and technology. Due to the fact that disclosure of certain information to any individual may be
deemed an export, Licensor agrees that it will not assign any worker to perform services under this Agreement on Licensee’s premises for the applicable program unless that person either receives a license for the export at issue or qualifies as
a “U.S. person.” The following persons shall be defined as a “U. S. person”:


i.	U.S. citizen;



ii.	U.S. nationals, including an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence (those possessing a valid Form I-550 or “green card”);



iii.	Alien admitted following a 1986 amnesty statute;



iv.	Asylee or refugee as defined in 8 U.S.C. 1324(b)(a)(3); or



v.	Alien lawfully admitted for temporary agricultural employment.


18.1    Access to Information

Licensor further agrees that, should Licensee determine that the work performed under this Agreement will enable persons working for the Licensor (including the Licensor)
to have access to unclassified information that relates to a U.S. Government classified program, or other information regulated by the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (‘NISPOM”), Licensor will not assign any worker to
perform services under this Agreement (including the Licensor) unless such persons are citizens or nationals of the United States.

In addition to the foregoing requirements, Licensor will comply with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (“IRCA”) and in particular, have all of its
applicable workers fill out an I-9 form, verifying their authorization to work in the United States.


** Material has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission.


14








Licensee agrees to conspicuously mark all documentation and technical information that is subject to a U.S. Government
classified program (including NISPOM). Licensee further agrees to use its best efforts to assist Licensor from time to time, upon request, to determine the appropriate export control classification of particular documentation and technical
information (e.g., whether subject to ITAR or EAR, and USML Category or Export Control Classification No.). Furthermore, Licensee represents and warrants to Licensor that all persons assigned by Licensee to communicate with Licensor in
connection with this Agreement are “U.S. persons” as defined in Section 18 above.

19    Gratuities

Licensor warrants that neither it nor any of its employees, agents or representatives have offered or given, or will offer or give, any gratuities to Licensee’s employees, agents or representatives for the purpose of securing this
Agreement or securing favorable treatment under this Agreement.

20    Publicity

Except as required
by law or applicable regulation (including without limitation, SEC and Nasdaq rules), neither Party shall issue any press release or make any other public statement or filing relating to this Agreement, any work done under this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without obtaining the prior written approval of the other party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) as to the contents and the manner of presentation and publication of such press
release or public statement.

21    [**]


22    Waiver

The failure of either Party to require performance by the other party of any provision
hereof shall not affect the full right to require such performance at any time thereafter; nor shall the waiver by either Party of a breach of any provision hereof or failure to enforce a right hereunder be taken or held to be a waiver of the
provision itself. No delay or omission by either Party to this Agreement in the exercise or enforcement of any of its powers or rights hereunder shall constitute a waiver of such power or right. A waiver by either Party of any provision of this
Agreement must be in writing and signed by such Party, and shall not imply subsequent waiver of that or any other provision.

23    Nature of Relationship

Nothing contained herein shall be construed as Licensee and Licensor creating a joint venture, agency, employment relationship, partnership, principal-agent, joint
development or other form of joint enterprise between the Parties. Neither Party shall be liable to any person for any debts, liabilities or obligations incurred by or on behalf of the other Party hereto or its business. Both Parties agree to
disclose in their respective dealings that they are separate entities.


** Material has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission.

24    Non-Solicitation

During the term of this Agreement and for [**] after its expiration or termination, neither Party will solicit for employment any employee
of the other Party who was involved in the performance of the Party’s obligations under this Agreement, unless the hiring party first obtains the written consent of the other party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party shall have the
right to hire any individual employed by the other who, without solicitation, responds to employment advertising in the newspapers, trade publications or other public commercial media or any unsolicited walk in candidates not related to this
Agreement.

25    Notices

Wherever under this Agreement one Party is required or permitted to give notice to the
other, such notice shall be in writing and shall be effected either by personal delivery or [**] after deposit in the United States mail, registered or certified, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to the receiving Party’s respective
address shown on the first page hereof, or via telefacsimile with confirmation receipt followed by U.S. mail. Each Party to this Agreement may from time to time change the address to which notices may be given by giving the other Party written

event there is any proceeding or lawsuit in connection with this Agreement, the prevailing party in such proceeding shall be entitled to receive its costs, expert witness fees and reasonable attorneys’ fees, including costs and fees on appeal.


27    Bankruptcy of InterDigital


The Agreement is to be interpreted in accordance with Section 365(n) of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code. It is understood and agreed that the intellectual property license under this Agreement is intellectual property as defined in Section 101(35A) of the Bankruptcy Code and that Section 365(n) shall govern this Agreement in the event
that InterDigital files for bankruptcy.

SOFTWARE LICENSE AND MARKETING AGREEMENT
Sonic Foundry Products

This Software License and Marketing Agreement (this ""Agreement"") is
entered into as of March 25, 2002, (the ""Effective Date"") between Broderbund

WHEREAS, Broderbund is in the business of developing, distributing,
licensing, marketing and publishing computer software products in the form of
computer programs and written documentation relating to their use;

WHEREAS, Licensor is the creator of the consumer computer software
programs listed on Exhibit A to this Agreement and the related documentation;

and

WHEREAS, Licensor and Broderbund desire that Broderbund publish and
distribute the consumer computer software programs listed on Exhibit A, subject
to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained
herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1.       DEFINITIONS.

or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with it

1.4    ""Cost of Goods"" means all costs and expenses associated with the
manufacture and delivery of the Products, including without limitation,

third parties.

1.5    ""Final Version"" means a non-copy protected and unencrypted disk
master of a Product, recorded in executable object code form according to the
agreed upon specifications attached hereto as Exhibit C (the ""Specifications"")
with any necessary supporting software and data and which Broderbund accepts as
conforming in all material respects to the Specifications and is completely
debugged and tested. All Final Versions shall contain an updated privacy policy

materials incurred by Broderbund shall be paid by Broderbund and shall not be
included in determining Net Receipts. The terms ""sell,"" ""sale,"" and other

6.       ROYALTIES.

6.1    Intentionally omitted.

6.2    Regular Royalty. Except as provided in Section 6.3, 6.4 and 6.5
Broderbund shall pay the royalty rates identified on Exhibit A on the Net
Receipts derived by Broderbund from the sale of the Products (the ""Royalty
Rate""). All royalties shall be subject to a fifteen percent [15%] royalty
reserve against returns. If Broderbund does not use the full amount of the
royalty reserve within 180 days from the quarter in which it is taken any excess
amount will be returned to Licensor with its next quarterly royalty statement.
Except as specifically provided on Exhibit A, any royalties to any third parties
for any content, code, technology, and the like, included in the Products are
the sole responsibility of Licensor.

6.3    Royalty Exceptions.

(a)    Broderbund shall be entitled to use and distribute a
reasonable number of Products without charge for internal purposes, promotional
purposes, as sales inducements (other than as inducements to end users) or
otherwise to distributors, dealers, reviewers and others, and no royalties shall
be payable to Licensor on such Products. In no event shall Broderbund use the
Products as ""loss leaders"" or give the Products away for free or nominal value,
except as set forth above.

(b)    No royalties shall be paid to Licensor on any revenue
derived from Broderbund's inclusion of any promotional information or
advertising placed on the Licensed Media.

6.4    Royalties on Bundling by Broderbund. In cases where Broderbund
bundles a Product with other software programs for distribution by Broderbund
for a single price, the royalty payable to Licensor shall be calculated as
follows:

(a)    Broderbund's SRP for the bundled Product shall be divided
by the sum of the then current SRPs for all of the software programs bundled in
the transaction in question. The resulting percentage shall be Licensor's share
of the transaction's Net Receipts for the bundled Product.

(b)    Licensor's share of the transaction's Net Receipts shall
be multiplied by the Royalty Rate.

(c)    If there is no established SRP for a product that is
included in such a transaction, Broderbund shall determine a commercially
reasonable SRP based on such factors as



5

<PAGE>

competitive products on the market, comparable products with equivalent
functionality, and lines of code contained in comparable products. If a
reasonable SRP for any title cannot be reasonably determined, the royalty shall
be determined by using the product of Net Receipts multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the sum of the number of Products in the Bundle, and the
denominator shall be the number of all titles in the Bundle.

6.5 Royalties on OEM Sales. In cases where Broderbund sublicenses the
rights to manufacture a Product to an OEM or other similar distributor, the
license fee that Broderbund receives from such OEM for the Broderbund products
shall be pro rated among the Products sublicensed to such OEM according to the
number of units actually replicated and distributed each quarter.

7.       Intentionally omitted.


8.       TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PAYMENT.

Royalties will be paid in accordance with the provisions of Section 6
of this Agreement. Net Receipts shall be calculated and royalties shall be paid
to Licensor quarterly. Payments shall be accompanied by a reasonably detailed
royalty report showing the calculation of the royalties. All payments will be
issued within forty five (45) days after the closing of the applicable quarterly
period. Late payments shall bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month or the
maximum allowed by law, whichever is less beginning twenty (20) days after the
date notice of late payment.

9.       TERM AND TERMINATION.

9.1      Term of Agreement. Unless terminated earlier pursuant to this
Section 9 this Agreement shall have a term of Effective Date through March 15,

Agreement shall continue in full force and effect after the expiration.

12.      ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.

Licensor hereby agrees that Broderbund has full discretion with respect
to the marketing of the Products pursuant to the licenses granted herein
including, but not limited to, the licensing of the Products alone or as part of
a bundle of other software or related products, the pricing of the Products and
the distribution of the Products. Licensor also acknowledges that nothing in
this Agreement shall require Broderbund to begin to market, or, once begun, to
continue to market, the Products if Broderbund, in its sole discretion,
determines that it would not be commercially reasonable to do so; provided,
however, upon any failure of Broderbund to market such Products that continues
for more than a continuous period of thirty (30) days or more, then upon notice
Licensor may terminate this Agreement immediately.

13.      ACCOUNTING.

Licensor may request a certified audit of Broderbund's sales records
pertaining to the Products for the preceding four (4) full quarters to be
performed by an independent certified public accountant that (a) shall be
reasonably acceptable to Broderbund and (b) shall not be compensated on a
contingency basis or otherwise have any financial interest in the outcome of
such audit. Any such audit shall be at the expense of Licensor. Licensor may not
request such an audit more than one (1) time within any twelve (12) month
period. The accountant shall be required to execute a confidentiality and
non-disclosure agreement if requested by Broderbund and shall hold all
information confidential. The accountant may reveal to Licensor only the

10

<PAGE>

amounts of any underpayment. The accountant shall provide to Broderbund a final
report of its work, including both overpayment and underpayment information. The
audit shall take place at Broderbund's principal place of business in the United
States for domestic sales or at Broderbund's applicable international offices
for foreign sales, during normal business hours and at a mutually agreed upon
time. If the audit reveals that Broderbund underpaid the royalties payable with
respect to the period for which the audit was performed by an amount in excess
of 5% of the amount owed, Broderbund shall promptly pay to Licensor the amount
of such underpayment plus the reasonable cost of the audit (not to exceed
$15,000). Any dispute relating to the audit findings shall be subject to the
arbitration provisions in this agreement.

14.      CONFIDENTIALITY.

14.1 Confidential Information. All documentation and information
designated in writing at the time of disclosure as proprietary or confidential
(""Confidential Information"") by the party disclosing the information (the

party royalty bearing technology. These Products will be subject to the royalty
obligations described above plus the following amounts based on net units sold,
as follows:

Sound Forge XP Studio      MP3      [******]
Acid Music                 MP3      [******]
Video Factory:             MPEG I   [******]

Broderbund shall pay these royalties directly to Licensor at the same time as
the royalties due to Licensor hereunder. Licensor must give thirty days prior
notice of any termination, modification or renewal of the agreements relating to
the third party content. If, during the term, the third party licenses are
renewed or altered resulting in a different royalty rate, Broderbund will pay
the new amount. Licensor shall be responsible for all royalty reporting and
payments to the third party licensors. Licensor agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless Broderbund from any claims relating to Licensor's failure to pay these
third party royalties, except to the extent such failure is the result of
Broderbund's failure to pay Licensor for such royalties.

Except for the third party royalties specifically described in this
Agreement, Licensor shall be solely responsible for any third party royalty
obligations relating to the Products to the extent Licensor decides to include
any third party technology in the Products that would require such additional
third party royalties.

2.   Guaranteed Royalty. Broderbund guarantees that Licensor shall receive no
less than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) in royalties under this
Agreement in the first full year of the Agreement (the ""Guaranteed Royalty""). If
after the first two full quarterly royalty periods, Licensor has not received
$50,000 in royalties from Broderbund, Broderbund will pay the difference with
the next quarterly royalty payment which shall be credited as an advance against
future royalties. If after four full quarterly royalty periods, Licensor has not
received $100,000 in royalties from Broderbund, Broderbund will pay the
difference with the next quarterly royalty payment, which shall be credited as
an advance against future royalties. The Guaranteed Royalty is non-refundable
under all circumstances and is due regardless of termination of this Agreement,
unless Licensor terminates the Agreement pursuant to Section 9.4 and in such
case the Guaranteed Royalty paid to date is not refundable, but Broderbund shall
not owe any Guaranteed Royalty not due and owing as of the date of termination.

3.   Purchase of Super Duper Music Looper Products. Upon execution of this
Agreement, Broderbund will issue a purchase order for 2,500 units of Super Duper
Music Looper at [******] per unit. Broderbund shall pay for these units net 30
days after delivery to Broderbund. As needed to fulfill customer demand,
Broderbund will purchase an additional 7,500 units of the Super Duper Music
Looper product on a consignment basis at [******] per unit. Broderbund

******Omitted and filed separately with the SEC

16

will pay the per unit fee for these products within thirty (30) days of receipt
of payment by Broderbund from its customers with respect to the consigned
products. All products will be in resale condition. Broderbund shall receive a
credit for all Product that is not in resale condition. Broderbund will not pay
the [******]% royalty on these of Super Duper Music Looper products. Broderbund
will sell the Super Duper Music Looper products in the following order: 1) the
2,500 purchased units, 2) the 7,500 consignment units and 3) any units
manufactured thereafter.

Technical Support

First Level Support

First Level Support will be resolved by Broderbund Technical Support department,
following these guidelines.

...    Broderbund technical support will be furnished with knowledge base content
of issues related to the operation of the program, including navigational,
how-to's, incompatibilities, etc., and the logs of calls history on all the
Products by Licensor.

...    Licensor will provide up to one week of training on the Products at
Broderbund's technical support facility at its sole expense.

...    Broderbund technical support will be furnished with access to all available
patches, software updates or other downloadable content that will be a
benefit to resolving the customer's issue.

...    All knowledge base and downloadable content will be placed out on the
Broderbund Support site for customer's to access for self-help.

...    The Broderbund representatives will answer customer's questions by using
the above-mentioned knowledge base content as well as using standard
operating system trouble shooting techniques.

...    If the issue was resolved using standard operating system trouble shooting
techniques, but is not in the knowledge base, Broderbund will add this as a
new issue for other representatives and customers to use in the future.

...    If, after these resources have been utilized, and the representative cannot
solve the customer's issue, the customer will be escalated to Second Level
Support.

Second Level Support

Second Level Support will be handled by Licensor, subject to the terms and
conditions of its then, if any, technical support. Broderbund technical support
staff will work directly with Licensor, ensuring that customer interface remains
only with Broderbund. The following are examples of the types of situations that
fall under second level support. Sonic Foundry, Inc. currently charges customers
for technical support at a rate of $3.00 for the first minute and $1.00 for each
additional minute. This policy and procedure would apply to Broderbund technical
support staff, after 10 hours of technical support provided free to Broderbund
technical support staff per month.

...    Any issue that cannot be resolved by using the content provided by Licensor
or by using standard operating system trouble shooting techniques.

...    Incompatibilities with newly released technologies, including operating
systems, hardware, and/or software applications that interact with the
program (i.e., Windows XP, Internet Explorer, printers, etc.). If a
solution is tested and proven to resolve the issue, the content can be
added to the Broderbund knowledge base for first level support.

...    Issues that originated from the design of the program that Broderbund is
not provided with a patch or solution to resolve the customer's situation.

software in executable code; and

WHEREAS, Copper Mountain desires to furnish such software to Customer,
and Customer desires to receive such software from Copper Mountain, on the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, Copper Mountain and Customer agree as follows:

AGREEMENT

1.       DEFINITIONS

All capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this Agreement
shall have the meanings given such terms in the Equipment Purchase Agreement.

Subscriber Equipment under the Equipment Purchase Agreement.

2.       DELIVERY OF SOFTWARE

Copper Mountain shall deliver to Customer one (1) copy of the Network
Firmware and Subscriber Firmware in machine-readable object code form with the

<PAGE>

3.       GRANT OF LICENSE

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Copper Mountain
hereby grants to Customer, and its customers which use the Equipment, a
perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license, effective upon
Customer's acceptance of the Equipment containing such Firmware, to use the
Firmware solely in conjunction with the use of such Equipment for the duration
of the useful life of such Equipment.

4.       RESTRICTIONS ON USE

All use of the Firmware not expressly permitted by this Agreement is
prohibited. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:

4.1   COPYING.  Customer may make up to two (2) copies of the Network
Firmware and the Subscriber Firmware solely for archival or back-up purposes.
All other copying is prohibited.

4.2   OTHER RESTRICTIONS. Customer may not (and shall not authorize any
third party to) alter, modify, adapt or translate any of the Firmware or create
any derivative work based thereon. Customer may not reverse engineer, decompile,
disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive the human-readable source code for
the Firmware. Customer may not alter or remove any copyright, trade secret,
patent, proprietary, or other legal notice on or in copies of the Firmware.

4.3   TRANSFERS. Customer may not sublicense, rent, loan, lease, or
otherwise transfer to any third party any of the Firmware, except that the
Subscriber Firmware may be transferred to, and Customer's rights under this
Agreement to use the Subscriber Firmware may be assigned to a purchaser of the

provided in Section 15.1 of this Agreement.

5.       NO LICENSE FEES

The right to use the Firmware is included in the purchase price of the
Equipment and there are no separate license fees or royalties for the Firmware.

6.       UPGRADES

This Agreement does not require Copper Mountain to provide any software
support services to Customer or to provide Customer with any enhancements,
updates, upgrades, new versions, or new releases (collectively, ""Upgrades"") of
the Firmware. Software support services shall be provided under a separate
agreement. If Copper Mountain furnishes any Upgrades to Customer, whether under
a separate agreement or otherwise, and Customer elects to receive such upgrades,
Customer shall promptly install (or permit Copper Mountain to install) and begin
using the Upgrade, and Customer's use of the Upgrade shall be subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement. Copper Mountain agrees to assist in
Customer's testing of new software releases and Upgrades when requested by
Customer, and Customer's decision to implement new software releases or Upgrades
will be based upon the successful completion of those tests. For support
purposes, the ""current"" software release is defined as the last software release
not known

2.
<PAGE>

to contain any problems, errors or bugs. Copper Mountain also agrees that
Customer may elect to use the current software release or Upgrade, or one of the
two previous software releases or Upgrades not known to contain problems, errors
or bugs, and that Copper Mountain will support those releases and Upgrades. Any
installation of Upgrades by Customer in accordance with procedures and
instructions provided by Copper Mountain shall not result in any termination of,
or adversely affect, any warranties by Copper Mountain relating to the
Equipment.

7.       REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

7.1   REPRESENTATIONS. Copper Mountain represents that the Firmware and
all documentation related thereto does not infringe upon any copyright, patent,
trademark, services mark, trade name, trade secret, or other proprietary right
of any third party. Copper Mountain represents that, to the best of its
knowledge, it has the necessary rights and licenses required to grant Customer
the right to purchase the Equipment and license the Firmware as provided under
this Agreement.

7.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY. During the applicable Warranty Period, Copper
Mountain warrants that the Firmware shall be free from programming errors that
impair the proper and intended performance and operation of the Equipment
containing such Firmware, and that all Equipment when using such Firmware and/or
Upgrades shall be Year 2000 Compliant (as provided in the Equipment Purchase
Agreement). All warranties provided herein with respect to Subscriber Firmware
shall be transferable to any permitted transferee of the Subscriber Equipment
containing such Firmware, but in no event shall the warranty on such Subscriber
Firmware exceed the Warranty Period applicable to the related Subscriber
Equipment as provided in the Equipment Purchase Agreement.

7.2   LIMITATIONS. The warranty in Section 7.2 does not apply to
Firmware that has been altered, modified, or improperly installed by anyone
other than Copper Mountain, (except Firmware or Upgrades installed in accordance
with the documentation provided by Copper Mountain). The warranty in Section 7.2
may not be transferred to any subsequent purchaser of the Equipment or any other
third party except by a subsequent purchaser from Customer in its ordinary
course of business, except as otherwise provided in Section 15.1 of this
Agreement.

7.3   REMEDIES. If, during the applicable Warranty Period, Customer
reports a malfunction in any Equipment containing Firmware and returns such
Equipment to the designated Copper Mountain facility, and Copper Mountain
determines that the malfunction is covered by the warranty in Section 7.2
(subject to the limitations in Section 7.3), Copper Mountain shall, as
Customer's sole and exclusive remedy for breach of these warranties and at
Copper Mountain's cost and option, either (a) correct the programming errors in
the Firmware, (b) furnish replacement Equipment with equivalent grade,
functionality and quality to Customer, or (c) if Copper Mountain determines that
(a) and (b) are not feasible, refund the purchase price paid for the Equipment
containing the defective Firmware. This action will be accomplished in a

3.
<PAGE>

commercially reasonable timeframe, and in no circumstances shall Copper Mountain
be obligated to procure substitute equipment for Customer.

7.4   DISCLAIMERS.

(a) EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN SECTION 7.2, COPPER
MOUNTAIN MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRMWARE,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

(b) Customer acknowledges that it has not relied on any
representations or warranties other than those in Section 7.2 or in any
documentation accompanying the Equipment.

8.       INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS

8.1   INDEMNIFICATION. Subject to Section 8.3 below, Copper Mountain
agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Customer, its officers, directors,
employees, agents and representatives from and against all claims, demands,
losses, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorney's fees) arising out of or relating to any claim, demand or judgment
that the authorized and proper use of the Firmware or the contents of any
documentation related thereto infringe any patent, copyright, trademark, service
mark, trade secret or other proprietary right of a third party; provided,
however, that Customer (a) promptly notifies Copper Mountain in writing of the
claim, (b) gives Copper Mountain the sole authority to control the defense and
settlement of the claim, and (c) cooperates and, at Copper Mountain's request
and expense, assists in the defense of the claim. Settlement of any such claim
by Copper Mountain shall include a complete and unconditional release in favor
of Customer.

8.2   MITIGATION. If any infringement claim covered by Section 8.1
arises or in Copper Mountain's opinion is likely to occur, Copper Mountain shall
immediately, at its option, (a) procure for Customer the right to use the
infringing Firmware, (b) replace the infringing Firmware with a non-infringing
substitute product that does not adversely affect the functionality of the
Equipment, or (c) refund to Customer the purchase price of the Equipment
containing the infringing Firmware. If Customer continues to use Firmware after
receiving notice of a claim or a ruling that Customer's use of such Firmware
infringes a third party's rights and after Customer shall have refused to comply
with Copper Mountain's proposed solution to such infringement in accordance with
this Section 8.2, Customer shall be responsible for any liability resulting from
such continued use after such refusal.

8.3   EXCLUSIONS. Copper Mountain shall have no liability for any claim
described in Section 8.1 if the claim is based on or arises from Customer's (a)
improper or unauthorized use or modification of any Firmware; (b) use of a
superseded or altered release of any Firmware if the claim would have been
avoided by use of current or unaltered versions or releases of such Equipment
that Copper Mountain provided to Customer; or (c) combination or use of any
Firmware with equipment, computer programs, data or other items not furnished by
Copper Mountain (or authorized by Copper Mountain in writing for such
combination or use), if the claim would have been avoided by use of the Firmware
without such equipment, computer

4.
<PAGE>

programs, data or other items. Customer shall indemnify and hold Copper Mountain
harmless for and against any and all liability, damages, losses, costs and
expenses (including attorney's fees) arising from any claim described in this
Section 8.3.

8.4   ENTIRE LIABILITY. Section 8 states Customer's exclusive remedy
and Copper Mountain's entire liability of any infringement claim relating to the
Firmware.

9.       LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1   IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR
ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES OF ANY KIND,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS, OR LOST DATA,
ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. EXCEPT FOR CLAIMS UNDER ARTICLE 8 HEREOF,
THE TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY OF EITHER PARTY TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY CLAIMS
OR CAUSES OF ACTION ARISING UNDER OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE EQUIPMENT
CONTAINING FIRMWARE (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE) SHALL NOT EXCEED
THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT PAID BY CUSTOMER TO COPPER MOUNTAIN FOR THE EQUIPMENT.

9.2   Customer understands that Copper Mountain's pricing is predicated
on the limitations of Copper Mountain's liability set forth in Section 9.1 and
acknowledges that Copper Mountain would not enter into this Agreement without
such limitations.

10.      CONFIDENTIALITY INFORMATION

Customer acknowledges that all technical documentation and information
delivered to Customer by Copper Mountain under this Agreement, and all other
information relating to the design, development, configuration, use,
installation, operation and maintenance of the System, constitute confidential
or proprietary information of Copper Mountain (collectively, ""Confidential
Information""). Customer shall not duplicate or disclose to any third person, and
shall not use for any purpose other than operation and maintenance of the
System, any Confidential Information without the prior written consent of a duly
authorized officer of Copper Mountain or unless required pursuant to any
process, proceeding or other action by any governmental, law enforcement agency

Confidential Information that Customer can demonstrate: (a) was or is wholly and
independently developed by Customer or lawfully received by Customer free of
restriction from another source having the rights to furnish such Confidential
Information; (b) has become generally available to the public without breach of
this Agreement; or (c) at the time of disclosure to Customer was known to
Customer free of restriction, as evidenced by documentation in Customer's
possession.

and interest in and to the Firmware and any and all maintenance releases,
enhancements, updates, upgrades, new versions, or new releases, modifications,

connection with any claim that the Licensed Products violates any patent,
trademark, copyright and any other intellectual or industrial property right of
third parties, finally awarded in any such claim, suit or proceeding. SMSI shall

release of the Licensed Products, (b) modification of the Licensed Products
without SMSI's written consent, (c) the combination or use of the Licensed

not furnished by SMSI or not contemplated under this Agreement, if such
infringement would have been avoided by the use of the Licensed Products as
contemplated herein or alone and in their current unmodified form. (d) OEM's
continued infringing activities after being notified thereof or after being
informed of modifications that would have avoided the infringement or (e) OEM's
use of the licensed product which is incidental to an infringement not resulting
primarily from the licensed product. OEM will indemnify SMSI from all damages
and liabilities related to a claim excluded from SMSI's indemnity obligation by
the previous sentence.

against any and all actions, suits, claims, liabilities, damages, losses and
expenses (including the reasonable fees of attorneys and other professionals and
related costs and expenses) arising directly or indirectly out of or in
connection with any claim related to the Hardware, the breach by OEM of any
warranty or obligation under this Agreement, or any claim that (1) the

regulation or violates any patent, trademark, copyright and any other
intellectual or industrial property right of third parties, or (2) of property
damage or personal injury or death arising from use of the Hardware, and to pay

indemnifying party with the assistance, information and authority necessary to
perform the above. However, if the other party desires to have separate legal
representation in any such action, it shall be responsible for the costs and
fees related to its separate counsel. In the event a product provided by the
indemnifying party is finally held or believed by the indemnifying party to
infringe a third party's rights, the indemnifying party, at its option, shall
use reasonable efforts to obtain a license under the rights that have been
infringed, or to modify the infringing product so it is non-infringing or to
provide to the other party substitute products that are non-infringing; provided
that if in the indemnifying party's judgment such options are not commercially
reasonable, the indemnifying party may terminate the licenses granted to the
other party hereunder upon written notice to the other party.

entitled to seek injunctive relief. OEM agrees and recognizes that SMSI may
suffer immediate and irreparable harm and money damages may not be adequate to
compensate SMSI or protect and preserve the status quo.

Charges), Section 8.5 (Limitation of Liability), Section 8.6 (Consequential
Damages), Section 9 (Indemnification), Section 10 (Proprietary Rights,

survive termination of any license hereunder.

Order Form, all subsequent increases or modifications to Customer’s order hereunder shall be deemed to be delivered under the same terms as the original license. Customer’s right to use each additional authorized copy of the Ariba
Products, as permitted under this Agreement, shall be deemed to arise at the location where the original was first installed.

6. TERMINATION

6.1 A party (“Terminating Party”) may, by written notice of default to the other party (“Terminated Party”), (i)
terminate this Agreement, in whole or in part, including any Order Forms or SOWs (a) if the Terminated Party materially breaches this Agreement, and the Terminated Party does not cure such material breach within thirty (30) calendar days after
receipt of written notice of such breach; or (b) immediately following the failure to resolve the suspension of business, insolvency, institution of bankruptcy, liquidation proceedings by or against the Terminated Party, appointment of a trustee or
receiver for the Terminated Party’s property or business, or any assignment, reorganization or arrangement by the Terminated Party for the benefit of its creditors; or (c) immediately upon a material breach of Section 2 (License) by the
Terminated Party, or (ii) terminate any individual Order Form or SOW if the Terminated Party fails to perform any provision of such Order Form or SOW and does not cure the breach within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of written notice
thereof.

6.2 Upon expiration or termination of this
Agreement, all of Customer’s licenses to use the Ariba Products, and all other rights, services and licenses granted by Ariba to Customer as set forth in this Agreement, shall cease immediately (except for those rights, licenses and obligations
that are expressly stated to survive termination of this Agreement).

6.3 If an Order Form or SOW (but not the Agreement) terminates or if the License Term of an applicable Ariba Product set forth in an Order From expires, all of Customer’s licenses to use the applicable Ariba Products, and all other
rights, services and licenses granted by Ariba to Customer as set forth in such Order Form or SOW, as applicable, shall cease immediately (except for those rights, licenses and obligations that are expressly stated to survive termination of such
Order Form). Termination of any single Order Form or SOW shall not result in the termination of this Agreement; however, termination of all Order Forms and SOWs shall result in the termination of this Agreement.

Within ten (10) days from the date of any termination, Customer shall provide
Ariba with a signed written statement by Customer certifying that Customer has not retained any copies of (i) the applicable Ariba Products and any accompanying Documentation, and (ii) any Ariba Confidential Information.

Termination of this Agreement or any license shall not limit either party
from pursuing other remedies available to it, including injunctive relief, nor shall such termination relieve Customer’s obligation to pay all fees that have accrued or are otherwise identified as being owed by Customer, now or at some future
date, under any Order Form or SOW.

7. NO WARRANTIES

THE ARIBA PRODUCTS AND ARIBA SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY
WHATSOEVER. ARIBA DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, AS TO ANY MATTER WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED







WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. ARIBA SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY WITH
RESPECT TO THE PERFORMANCE OF ANY PRODUCT AND CUSTOMER SHALL HAVE NO REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO PRODUCT PERFORMANCE. ARIBA DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE ARIBA PRODUCTS OR ARIBA SERVICES, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, ARE ERROR OR BUG FREE, OR THAT CUSTOMER’S
USE OF THE ARIBA PRODUCTS OR ARIBA SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED.

8.
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT FOR (I) A BREACH BY CUSTOMER OF THE
LICENSE RESTRICTIONS IN SECTION 2.3, OR (II) PAYMENT OF AUDIT COSTS PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 or (III) A BREACH BY CUSTOMER OF SECTION 4.1 SOLELY FOR FAILURE OF CUSTOMER TO PAY THE FEES DUE AND PAYABLE UNDER SECTION 4.1 (IN WHICH CASE CUSTOMER’S
TOTAL AND AGGREGATE LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO ONLY THE AMOUNT OF THE FEES STILL DUE AND PAYABLE UNDER SECTION 4.1 IF ANY), A PARTY’S TOTAL AND AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, AN ORDER FORM, AND SOW SHALL NOT
EXCEED ONE DOLLAR. EXCEPT FOR A BREACH BY CUSTOMER OF THE LICENSE RESTRICTIONS IN SECTION 2.3, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY OR ANY OF THEIR AFFILIATES, AGENTS, OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE UNDER ANY CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL
OR EQUITABLE THEORY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES RESULTING FROM INTERRUPTION OF USE, COST OF COVER, LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA, LOST
PROFITS OF THE OTHER PARTY OR ANY OF THE OTHER PARTY’S AFFILIATES, LOSSES RESULTING FROM SYSTEM SHUTDOWN, FAILURE TO ACCURATELY TRANSFER, READ OR TRANSMIT INFORMATION, FAILURE TO UPDATE OR PROVIDE CORRECT INFORMATION, STOLEN OR MISUSED
PASSWORDS, SYSTEM INCOMPATIBILITY OR PROVIDING INCORRECT COMPATIBILITY INFORMATION, OR BREACHES IN SYSTEM SECURITY, WHETHER OR NOT A PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF
ANY REMEDY, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, AN ORDER FORM, AND SOW. THIS SECTION 8 SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED TO AND SHALL NOT PROVIDE ANY PARTY ANY TYPE OR CATEGORY OF DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THOSE CATEGORIES LISTED
ABOVE, NOT OTHERWISE AVAILABLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.

9. CONFIDENTIALITY


A party (the “Discloser”) may disclose to the other
party (the “Recipient”) information that the Discloser considers to be confidential and at the time of disclosure is identified as confidential and/or proprietary (“Confidential Information”). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, Confidential Information shall be deemed to include the Ariba Products, the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including pricing), and either party’s technical and business information relating to
inventions or software, research and development, future product specifications, implementation methodologies, engineering processes, costs, profit or margin information, and marketing and future business plans. The parties agree, unless required by
law, not to use or make each other’s Confidential Information available to any third party for any purpose other than as necessary to perform under this Agreement. Recipient shall protect the Confidential Information of Discloser by using the
same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable degree of care, that it uses to protect its own confidential information of a like nature to prevent its unauthorized use, dissemination or publication by its employees or agents. Both parties
acknowledge that any breach of its obligations with respect to Confidential Information may cause the other irreparable injury for which there are inadequate remedies at law and that Discloser shall be entitled to seek equitable relief in addition
to all other remedies available to it. Customer shall not disclose the results of any performance tests of the Ariba Products to any third party without Ariba’s prior written approval. A party’s Confidential Information shall not include
information that: (i) is or becomes publicly available through no act or omission of Recipient; (ii) was in the Recipient’s lawful possession prior to the disclosure and was not obtained by Recipient either directly or indirectly from the
Discloser; (iii) is lawfully disclosed to the Recipient by a third party without restriction on Recipient’s disclosure, and where Recipient was not aware that the information was the confidential information of Discloser; (iv) is independently
developed by the Recipient without violation of this Agreement; or, (v) which is disclosed by Recipient







as needed to comply with a court order, subpoena, or other government demand (provided that Recipient first notifies
Discloser and gives Discloser the opportunity to challenge such court order, subpoena, or government demand).

10. TRADEMARKS

Neither party grants
the other party any rights to use its trademarks, service marks, or other proprietary symbols or designations (“Trademarks”) without the written consent of the other party, except as otherwise described herein. Neither party will combine
the other’s Trademarks so as to effectively create a unitary composite mark, nor shall it use any product name or trademark in a manner that is confusingly similar to the other party’s Trademark.

11. INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK.

12. AUDIT

Customer agrees to allow a mutually acceptable independent certified public accountant to audit and analyze the Customer’s compliance
with the terms of this Agreement. Any such audit shall be permitted by Customer within thirty (30) days of Ariba’s written request and shall be performed during normal business hours at times mutually agreed upon by Customer and Ariba. Audits
shall be made no more frequently than once every twelve (12) months, and shall not unreasonably interfere with Customer’s business activities. If an audit should reveal a discrepancy between the Fees owed Ariba and the Fees actually paid by
Customer, Customer will promptly pay the difference. In the event an audit should establish an underpayment of greater than ten percent (10%) of payments owed Ariba for any particular period, Customer shall be responsible for reimbursement of all
reasonable, verifiable costs related to the performance of the subject audit (collectively, “Audit Costs”).

13. FORCE MAJEURE

Neither party shall be liable to the other for failure or delay in the performance of a required obligation if such failure or delay is caused by riot, fire, flood, earthquake, natural disaster, electronic virus,
electronic attack or infiltration, internet disturbance, government act or other similar cause beyond such party’s (the “Affected Party”) control (collectively, a “Force Majeure Event”), provided that Affected Party gives
prompt notice of such condition, uses reasonable efforts to resume its full performance as soon as possible, and provided further that the other party (the “Non-Affected Party”) may terminate the affected Order Form or SOW if such
condition continues for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days. During the Force Majeure Event, the Non-Affected Party may similarly suspend its performance obligations, until such time as the Affected Party resumes its performance obligations.


14. MISCELLANEOUS

14.1 Customer shall not assign, sublicense or otherwise transfer this
Agreement, including any license, Order Forms or SOWs, in whole or in part, even in the event of merger or acquisition, without the prior written consent of Ariba.

14.2 The parties hereto are and shall remain independent contractors, and nothing herein shall be deemed to cause this
Agreement to create an agency, partnership, or joint venture between the parties hereto. Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted or construed as creating or establishing the relationship of employer and employee between Customer and either
Ariba or any employee or agent of Ariba.

14.3 The failure of
either party to act in the event of a breach of this Agreement by the other shall not be deemed a waiver of such breach or a waiver of future breaches, unless such waiver is provided to the other party in writing and signed by the party against whom
enforcement is sought.

14.4 The Ariba Products may require a
license for export from the U.S. Government that requires advance disclosure of the ultimate consignee and all parties to the sale, and prohibits diversion, transshipment, or reexportation out of the United States contrary to U.S. law and
regulations. Both parties agree to comply with all relevant export laws and regulations. The Customer agrees to furnish







all documentation required by the U.S. Government in connection with obtaining any required export license, and agrees
that unauthorized diversion, transshipment or reexportation of the Ariba Products in violation of the export license or any applicable law shall not be permitted.

14.5 Any and all provisions or obligations contained in this Agreement which by their nature or effect are required or
intended to be observed, kept or performed after termination of this Agreement will survive the termination of this Agreement and remain binding upon and for the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assignees.

14.6 Any notice given under this Agreement shall be in writing and in the
English language and shall be delivered by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested or by an overnight courier service with delivery receipt. All notices to Ariba must be sent to the attention of Ariba at the address
set forth on the Order Form or SOW to which the matter relates, copy to General Counsel. Notices to Customer shall be sent to the address set forth in the address block in an applicable Order Form or to any other address Customer specifies in
writing.

14.7 This Agreement and any Order Form or SOW, and
any disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement and any Order Form or SOW, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California. The Parties shall attempt to resolve all disputes between the Parties
arising out of or relating to this Agreement and any Order Form or SOW amicably through good faith discussions upon the written request of any Party. In the event that any such dispute cannot be resolved thereby within a period of thirty (30) days
after such notice has been given, such dispute shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration in San Francisco, California, using the English language in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS then in effect. The Parties
agree that Hon. Daniel Weinstein (Ret.) shall retain jurisdiction to resolve any disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement and any Order Form or SOW. In the event Judge Weinstein is not able to preside over the arbitration, the matter
will be submitted to arbitration before Hon. Charles B. Renfrew (Ret.). If Hon. Charles B. Renfrew (Ret.) is not able to preside, the dispute shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration In San Francisco, California, using the English language
in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS, including the arbitrator selection procedures, then in effect. The Parties consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction over each of them by the federal and state courts within the
State of California for the purposes of enforcing any arbitration award that may result from arbitration proceedings instituted to resolve any disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement and any Order Form or SOW, or to prevent any
threatened violation of this Agreement and any Order Form or SOW.

14.8 If any end user of the Ariba Products is an agency or department of the U.S. Government (“Government”), the use, duplication, reproduction, release, modification, disclosure, or transfer of the Ariba Products, or any related
documentation of any kind, including but not limited to technical data or manuals, is restricted in accordance with FAR 12.212 for civilian agencies and DFAR Supplement 227.7202 for military agencies. The Ariba Products are commercial computer
software and commercial computer software documentation. The use of the Ariba Products by the Government is further restricted in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

14.9 This Agreement shall not be construed against the party preparing it but shall be construed as if both parties jointly
prepared this Agreement, and any uncertainty and ambiguity shall not be interpreted against any one party.

14.10 If any provision of this Agreement shall be adjudged to be unenforceable or invalid in accordance with the procedures in 14.7, that provision shall
be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and remain enforceable between the parties.

14.11 The section headings appearing in this Agreement are inserted only as a matter of convenience and in no way define,
limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section or in any way affect such section.

14.12 This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in two or more counterparts, each of which will be considered an original, but all of which together
will constitute one and the same instrument. For clarification purposes, the dates contained in the signature blocks of this Agreement







or any documents executed pursuant to this Agreement only indicate the date(s) upon which such document was signed, and
shall have no effect on any other term of this Agreement. The parties may treat faxed documents as originals; however, this shall not preclude either party from requiring the exchange of original signatures.

14.13 This Agreement envisions the creation of one or more Order Forms or
SOWs for the purchase of Ariba Products and/or Services, respectively. In the absence of an applicable Order Form or SOW, this Agreement shall have no effect. Such Order Forms may be executed concurrently or subsequently with this Agreement. Each
Order Form or SOW executed under this Agreement shall incorporate the terms and conditions of this Agreement and, along with any documents incorporated by reference into this Agreement or the applicable Order Form or SOW, shall constitute a
complete, absolute integration and the entire agreement between the parties of such Order Form or SOW relating to the subject matter thereof, and shall supersede all prior representations, proposals, discussions, and communications, whether oral or
in writing, and all contemporaneous oral communications related to such matters. Notwithstanding the content of any purchase order, sale order, sale confirmation or any other document or web site relating to the subject matter of this Agreement,
this Agreement and any Order Form and/or SOW shall take precedence over any such document, and any conflicting, inconsistent, or additional terms contained therein shall be null and void. In the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions
of this Agreement and any individual Order Form or SOW, the Order Form or SOW shall govern. This Agreement and any Order Form or Sow incorporating this Agreement may be modified only in writing and shall be enforceable in accordance with its terms
if such written modification is signed by the party to be bound.

Non-performance of the contract terms.



In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to the above, Licensor shall have the right to take possession of the Software.


Termination of this Agreement shall not
relieve either party of its obligations pursuant to Sections 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 hereof.

6. INDEMNIFICATION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

Licensee agrees to indemnify and hold Licensor harmless from and against all loss, cost, expense or liability (including reasonable
attorney’s fees) arising out of a claim by a third party against Licensor based upon Licensee’s use of the Software.

Licensee agrees to indemnify and hold Licensor harmless from any loss or damages to Licensor related to, or associated with
Licensee’s customizations, updates and/or corrections to the Software.

Licensee agrees to indemnify and hold Licensee harmless, and defend at its expense, any action brought against Nationwide, its officers, directors, employees, shareholders, legal representatives, agents, successors
and assigns (“Nationwide Indemnified Parties”) to the extent that it is based on a claim that the customizations, updates and/or corrections developed by Licensee infringe any intellectual property rights of any third parties.


Licensor shall have no liability to Licensee for any
damage sustained by Licensee as a result of Licensee’s use of the Software, whether such damages would arise as a result of breach of contract, tort or otherwise. Licensee has tested the Software and relies on its own judgment in utilizing it.


Licensor warrants that the use of the
initially provided Software will not infringe any patent, copyright, or trademark in the United States or elsewhere, and Licensor shall indemnify and hold Licensee harmless against any and all losses, damages and expenses, (including attorney’s
fees and other costs of defending any infringement action) which Licensee may sustain or incur as a result of a breach of this warranty.

Obligations set forth herein are contingent upon the other party:


a)
Providing the indemnifying party with prompt written notice of any action brought against the other party; and




b)
The other party cooperating with the indemnifying party in the defense of any such action, and allowing the indemnifying party to control the defense and
settlement of any such action at its expense;




4








Licensor shall have no obligation to defend any action or indemnify Licensee from damage
if:


(i)
Licensee, in providing customizations, updates and/or corrections to the Software, infringes upon the intellectual property of any third party.





(ii)
Licensee is not using the most current version of the Software and the action would have been avoided without such combined use.




(iii)
Licensee has modified the Software in combination with other Software and the action would have been avoided without such combined use.





(iv)
Licensee is using the Software in combination with other Software and the action would have been avoided without such combined use




7. FORCE MAJUERE

Either party shall be excused from failures or delays in
delivery or performance hereunder if such failure or delay is attributable to causes beyond the reasonable control of the party, which makes such performance or delivery commercially impractical. In the event of any such delay, the time of delivery
or performance and time of payment shall be extended for a period of time equal to the time lost by reason of such delay (unless otherwise specified in writing between the parties hereto).

8. NOTICES

All notices shall be in writing and shall be deemed to be
delivered when deposited in the United States Postal Services, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, or when sent by telegram, telex, or facsimile. All notices shall be directed to Licensee or to Licensor, its successors or assigns, at the
respective addresses set forth on the signature page of this Agreement or to such other address as one party may, from time to time, designate by notice to the other party.

9. RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES

The parties to this Agreement are affiliated companies and this Agreement will not establish any
relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency between the Parties. Neither Party will have the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other’s behalf without the other’s prior written consent.


10. PUBLICITY

A public press announcement related this Agreement may be
made, but only if mutually agreed to in writing by the Parties.

11. WAIVER

This Agreement constitutes the complete and exclusive
statement of this agreement between the parties hereto and supersedes any and all prior express implied agreements or understandings between the parties hereto concerning the subject matter hereof. No amendment, waiver or other alteration of this
Agreement may be made except by mutual agreement in writing.

parties shall negotiate replacement provisions for those provisions which are held invalid, illegal or unenforceable which as closely as possible express the intent of those provisions.

13. RESTRICTIONS OF TRANSFER

This Agreement and the rights and obligations under this Agreement shall not be transferable, sublicensable
or assignable to any other person, firm or corporation by Licensee, without the express prior written consent of the Licensor. The rights and obligations of this Agreement shall insure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto, their
successors and permitted assigns.

14.

This Agreement shall be
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio.

15. NO CONSTRUCTION AGAINST THE DRAFTER

EXHIBIT 10.16

SOFTWARE LICENSE AND SERVICES AGREEMENT

This Software License and Services Agreement (""Agreement"") is made and entered
into as of this 11th day of November, 1999, between BroadVision, Inc.
(""BroadVision"") and

Company   ReSourcePhoenix.com
(""Customer"")

Address   2401 Kerner Blvd.
San Rafael, CA 94901-5529

In  consideration  of the mutual  covenants  and  conditions  contained  in this
Agreement,  the  parties  agree as stated  herein.  The  following  attachments,
required when applicable, are also part of this Agreement:

A.   Current Licensing Practices
B.   Required Provisions of Sublicenses
C.   Professional Services Terms and Conditions
D.   Business Terms

1.   LICENSE.

A.   BroadVision  hereby grants to Customer a perpetual (unless  terminated
as set forth herein),  nonexclusive,  and  nontransferable  (except in
accordance  with the provisions of Section 11.B)  license,  subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, to use the object code for
the Software. For the purpose of this Agreement, ""Software"" shall mean
all versions, including current, previous, and subsequent versions, of
all software  products,  together with  operating  instructions,  user
manuals,  training  material,  and  other  documentation  as  may,  in
BroadVision's sole discretion, be supplied to Customer.

B.   Customer  may  use  the  Software  in  accordance  with  BroadVision's
published  licensing practices in force at the time of delivery of the
applicable   Software   products.   BroadVision's   current  licensing
practices are as set forth in Attachment A. If BroadVision changes its
licensing  practices,  BroadVision  will give Customer advance written
notice  of  such  changes  and  such  changes  will be  applicable  to
subsequent  purchases  of Software  licenses  by  Customer  hereunder;
provided that,  unless otherwise  agreed by the parties,  such changes
will not be  effective  with  respect to future  purchases of Software
licenses of the type previously  purchased by Customer for a period of
six (6) months from the date BroadVision gives Customer notice of such
changes.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or
in any other order forms, attachments,  quotes or other documentation,
Customer may purchase at any time any BroadVision products or services
generally available to any BroadVision customers.  Such purchase shall
be  subject  to  discount   rates  set  forth  in  any  agreements  or
attachments  provided by BroadVision  with respect to such purchase or
otherwise at prices agreed by the parties.

C.   Customer  may  not  (a)  rent,  lease,  or  loan  the  Software;   (b)
electronically   transmit  the  Software  over  a  network  except  as
necessary  for  Customer's  licensed  use of  the  Software;  (c)  use
run-time  versions of  third-party  products  supplied by  BroadVision
embedded in the Software,  if any, for any use other than the intended
use of the Software; (d) modify,  disassemble,  decompile,  or reverse
engineer  the  Software;  (e) transfer  possession  of any copy of the
Software to another party,  except as expressly  permitted  herein; or
(f) use the  Software in any way not  expressly  provided  for in this
Agreement.  There are no  implied  licenses.  Customer  agrees  not to
exceed the scope of the licenses granted herein.

D.   BroadVision also grants to Customer the right to grant nontransferable
sublicenses  to  portions  of the  Software,  where  such  grants  are
explicitly permitted by BroadVision's  licensing  practices.  Customer
shall require each such sublicensee,  before it may use or install the
sublicensed   Software,   to  execute  a  written  license   agreement
containing,  at  a  minimum,  the  required  provisions  specified  in
Attachment B. Customer  shall  indemnify  BroadVision  for all losses,
costs,  damages,  expenses,  and liabilities caused by a sublicensee's
failure  to honor  the  terms  of such  sublicense,  or by  Customer's
failure to include  required terms in its sublicense  agreements  with
its sublicensees.

2.   PAYMENT PRICES.

A.   Invoices  shall be issued upon  delivery of the  products or services,
unless specified herein to the contrary,  and shall be due and payable
in United States  currency upon receipt by Customer.  Payment shall be
overdue  thirty (30) days after the  delivery  date  specified  on the
invoice.  Overdue payments shall be subject to a finance charge of one
and one-half  percent (1 1/2%) for each month or fraction thereof that
the invoice is overdue,  or the highest  interest  rate  permitted  by
applicable  law,  whichever  is  lower.   BroadVision  shall  also  be
reimbursed  for its  collection  costs in the event of late  payments,
including reasonable attorney's fees.

B.   Software will be shipped FOB  BroadVision's  facility in Redwood City,
California,    U.S.A.,   by   commercial    surface    transportation.
Transportation  charges  in  excess  of such  rates  will be billed to
Customer. Software shall be deemed accepted upon delivery.

C.   The prices  stated in  BroadVision  quotations  are  exclusive  of any
federal, state, municipal,  value-added,  foreign withholding or other
governmental taxes, duties, fees, excises, or tariffs now or hereafter
imposed on the production,  storage,  licensing, sale, transportation,
import,   export,   or  use  of  the  Software  or  any  improvements,
alterations,   or  amendments  to  the  Software.  Customer  shall  be
responsible for, and if necessary reimburse,  BroadVision for all such
taxes, duties,  fees, excises, or tariffs,  except for governmental or
local taxes imposed on BroadVision's corporate net income.

3.   SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE.

A.   BroadVision  agrees to  provide  Customer  with  software  maintenance
subject to the following provisions and conditions:

i.   At  Customer's   request,   BroadVision  shall  provide  software
maintenance  at  prices  to  be  quoted  to  Customer.   Software
maintenance  shall  include (i)  telephone  and  electronic  mail
support provided during  BroadVision's  normal working hours, and
(ii) standard releases  containing  improvements or modifications
to the Software, where such improvements or modifications are not
priced as separate new products or options (""Standard Release"").

ii.  BroadVision  shall provide software  maintenance for any Standard
Release until one year after shipment of the subsequent  Standard
Release.

iii. Customer  shall  designate  four  or,  with  BroadVision's  prior
written approval,  more than four,  Support Contact Persons,  who
shall  be  responsible  for   communicating   support  issues  to
BroadVision.  Each  Support  Contact  Person will be  technically
competent  with respect to the Software and  knowledgeable  about
the  Customer's  environment  on  which  the  Software  is  used.
Customer  agrees  to  provide  BroadVision  with  timely  written
notification   containing   all  details  of  software   problems
necessary for  BroadVision  to diagnose such  problems.  Customer
agrees  to  cooperate   fully  in  providing   BroadVision   with
Customer's  source  code,  in  machine-readable  form,  and other
materials  necessary  to reproduce a reported  software  problem.
Subject to Customer's security  requirements,  Customer agrees to
provide  BroadVision  reasonable direct or remote access and test
time  on  Customer's  BroadVision  system,  for  the  purpose  of
diagnosing  reported software problems.  If BroadVision  provides
on-site  services  at  Customer's   request  in  connection  with
software  maintenance,  Customer shall reimburse  BroadVision for
all travel and other reasonable  out-of-pocket  expenses incurred
with respect to such services.

iv.  Software  maintenance may also include any patch releases (""Patch
Releases"") that BroadVision,  in its sole discretion and expense,
makes available.  Patch Releases are intended to address material
deviations between the Software and its published  specifications
until a Standard  Release  can be made  available.  Customer  may
install Patch Releases at its option.

v.   BroadVision  shall not be responsible  for  maintaining  Software
that fails to comply with its  published  specifications  if such
non-compliance  is the result of  modification of the Software by
Customer or third parties.  If BroadVision  expends its time on a
noncompliance  found to be the  result  of any of the  preceding,
Customer  shall pay  BroadVision  for such time at  BroadVision's
then-current hourly consulting rate.

B.   BroadVision  will  provide  at least 60 days  written  notice  of each
annual renewal  (including the amount of the annual  maintenance fee),
and Customer may renew software  maintenance may for a one-year period


Page 2 of 6
<PAGE>
at  BroadVision's  then-current  prices for  software  maintenance  by
delivering  BroadVision a purchase order for such renewal on or before
the  renewal  date.  In no event will the  Software  maintenance  fee,
expressed as a percentage of list price for the Software,  increase by
more than the greater of five  percent  (5%) or the increase in the US
Consumer  Price  Index  over the  amount  charged  the  previous  year
(subject  to  adjustments  resulting  from  Software  being  added  to
maintenance  coverage during the prior maintenance period or as of the
start  of  the  renewal  period).  In the  event  of  termination  for
Customer's  breach or Customer's  convenience,  all  maintenance  fees
shall be immediately due and payable  without notice;  in the event of
termination  for any other  reason,  Customer  shall be  entitled to a
refund of  maintenance  fees  already  paid,  prorated  for the unused
portion of such fees.

C.   Annual software  maintenance  fees are due and payable in advance;  in
all other respects payments are subject to the terms and conditions of
the Agreement.  Subject to adjustment for Software  license  purchases
made during an annual maintenance period, annual maintenance fees as a
percent of list price for the  Software to which the  maintenance  fee
applies will not increase by more than five percent (5%) per year.

D.   If  Customer   initially   declines  software   maintenance  and  then
subsequently elects to commence maintenance,  or if maintenance for an
item of  Software  is  discontinued  at  Customer's  request  and then
subsequently  renewed,  Customer shall pay the  maintenance  fees that
would have been due for the period  during which  maintenance  was not
provided.

4.   TITLE TO SOFTWARE.

A.   Customer shall include  BroadVision's  copyright or proprietary rights
notice on any  copies of the  Software  or  associated  documentation,
including  copyright or  proprietary  rights  notices of third parties
that  are   included  on  media  or  in   documentation   provided  by
BroadVision.  Customer  acknowledges that the Software is the property
of BroadVision or its licensors.

B.   Unless otherwise requested by BroadVision,  Customer shall ensure that
the phrase,  ""Personalized  by  BroadVision  One-To-One""  shall appear
prominently on the logon screen, splash screen, or other first view of
the Customer's  application  seen by consumers or other end-users when
they enter such  application.  The above  phrase  shall be a hypertext
link to a URL specified by  BroadVision.  Customer's use of the phrase
shall be in accordance  with  BroadVision's  guidelines for use of the
mark.

5.   WARRANTY.

BroadVision  warrants  that  the  Software  will  conform  in all  material
respects  to its  written  specifications  when  installed  and for 90 days
thereafter.  For  purposes  of this  Agreement,  the  sole  source  of such
specifications shall be BroadVision's written user documentation.  Customer
will notify BroadVision within 10 days after the expiration of the warranty
period of any nonconformity.  Where a material  nonconformity exists within
the  warranty  period,  and proper  notice  has been given to  BroadVision,
BroadVision will, as its sole and exclusive liability to Customer,  use due
diligence to correct the  nonconformity  and provide Customer with one copy
of any such corrected version of the Software, or, if BroadVision is unable
to correct such nonconformances  within a reasonable period of time, refund
all license fees paid to it for the Software,  or the most recent  software
maintenance fee paid for the Software,  if the  nonconformity  relates to a
Standard Release delivered  pursuant to Section 3 herein.  THIS WARRANTY IS
IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS,  EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,  AND
BROADVISION  EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT.

<PAGE>
6.   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

Except for  BroadVision's  liability  to Customer  under  Section 7 of this
Agreement,  BroadVision's liability to Customer under this Agreement or for
any other reason relating to the products and services  provided under this
Agreement, including claims for contribution or indemnity, shall be limited
to the amount paid to BroadVision under this Agreement. NOTWITHSTANDING THE
FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL  PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT,  CUSTOMER
AGREES  THAT  IN  NO  EVENT  SHALL   BROADVISION  BE  LIABLE  FOR  SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL,  OR  CONSEQUENTIAL  DAMAGES,  INCLUDING LOST PROFITS OR LOSS OF
USE.

7.   INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS INDEMNITY.

This Section 7 sets forth  BroadVision's  sole and  exclusive  liability to
Customer and Customer's sole and exclusive rights against BroadVision, with
respect to any claim  relating  to any  alleged or actual  infringement  or
misappropriation  by BroadVision of any third party  intellectual  property
right.  BroadVision will defend any action against  Customer  claiming that
the Software  constitutes  infringement of a duly issued patent existing or
issued  prior to the  initial  delivery  date of the  applicable  Software,
copyright, trademark, or trade secret. BroadVision shall indemnify Customer
for any  reasonable  expense  incurred by Customer in  connection  with the
foregoing.  BroadVision's  obligations  under this section are  conditioned
upon BroadVision  having sole control of any such action, and upon Customer
notifying  BroadVision  immediately  in  writing  of the claim  and  giving
authority,  information,  and assistance necessary to settle or defend such
claim. If the use of the Software infringes or is enjoined,  or BroadVision
believes it is likely to infringe or be enjoined,  BroadVision  may, at its
sole  option,  (i) procure for  Customer  the right to continue  use of the
licensed Software as furnished;  (ii) replace the licensed Software;  (iii)
modify the licensed Software to make it  non-infringing,  provided that the
Software still substantially conforms to the applicable specifications;  or
(iv) if BroadVision,  after using all commercially  reasonable  efforts, is
unable to  accomplish  the  foregoing  remedies,  terminate the license and
refund the license fee for the Software, less a proportional adjustment for
the time the Software was used by Customer,  equal to the ratio of the time
elapsed since the delivery date to five (5) years.  The indemnity  provided
herein shall not apply if the alleged infringement arises from: (a) the use
of other than a  currently  supported,  unaltered  release of the  licensed
Software;  (b) the use of  Software  that has been  modified or merged with
other  programs by  Customer;  or (c) the use of the  licensed  Software in
combination  with  software or hardware not provided  under this  Agreement
(other than software and hardware described in BroadVision's specifications
or  documentation  for the  Software  as  capable  of being  used  with the
Software or as otherwise agreed in writing by  BroadVision).  The foregoing
states BroadVision's sole and exclusive liability for patent, copyright, or
other proprietary rights infringement.

8.   CONFIDENTIALITY OF SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTS.

A.  Customer  shall not  reproduce,  duplicate,  copy,  sell,  or otherwise
disclose,   or   disseminate   the   Software,    including   operating
instructions,  user  manuals,  and  training  materials,  in any medium
except as authorized herein.  Customer may make copies of the Software,
in machine readable form, only as is reasonably  necessary for archival
and backup purposes.

B.  Customer expressly  undertakes,  using reasonable efforts not less than
it  exercises  for  its  own  confidential   materials,  to  retain  in
confidence,  and to require its employees or  consultants to retain the
Software  in  confidence,  and  will  make no use of such  information,
except under the terms and during the existence of this Agreement,  and
only to the extent that such use is necessary to  Customer's  employees
or consultants in the course of their employment.

C.  The  provisions of this section shall survive the  termination  of this
Agreement for a period of five (5) years.

D.  Customer  shall  not  release  the  results  of  any  benchmark  of the
Software,  or of any third party  products  embedded  in the  Software,
without BroadVision's prior written approval.

9.   AUDIT RIGHTS.

At  BroadVision's  request,  but in no  event  more  than  twice  annually,
Customer shall provide  BroadVision  with a report detailing its use of the
Software.  No more than once  annually,  BroadVision  may audit  Customer's
pertinent  records to ensure that license and other fees have been properly
paid in compliance with this Agreement.  BroadVision  will give Customer at
least three business days notice of its intention to perform such an audit.
Any  such  audit  will  be  conducted  during  regular  business  hours  at
Customer's  offices and shall not interfere  unreasonably  with  Customer's
business  activities.  If an audit  reveals that Customer has underpaid its
total  fees by more  than  five  percent  (5%),  then  Customer  shall  pay


Page 4 of 6
<PAGE>
BroadVision's  reasonable costs of conducting the audit, in addition to the
underpaid  amount;  provided,  that if  Customer  reasonably  disputes  the
findings  of such an audit  and  Customer  and  BroadVision  are  unable to
resolve  the  dispute,  Customer  and  BroadVision  will  select a mutually
agreeable  an  independent  auditor to review the audit work  performed  by
BroadVision.  If the independent  audit reveals that Customer has underpaid
its total  fees by more  than  five  percent  (5%),  Customer  will pay the
reasonable  costs of  conducting  both  BroadVision's  and the  independent
auditor's  audits.  If the  independent  audit  reveals  that  Customer has
underpaid its total fees by five percent (5%) or less, BroadVision will pay
the reasonable costs of conducting both  BroadVision's  and the independent
auditor's audits.

10.  TERM/TERMINATION.

This  Agreement  is effective on the earlier of (i) the date of shipment of
the  Software  or (ii)  the date  set  forth  above,  and  continues  until
terminated as provided herein, or by agreement of both parties. BroadVision
may  terminate  this  Agreement  upon:  (a)  any  material  breach  of this
Agreement by Customer that is not cured within 10 business  days  following
written notice thereof;  or (b) failure by Customer to pay license fees for
Software  under the payment terms  specified in this Agreement or as stated
on  BroadVision's  invoice  for such  Software.  Upon  termination  of this
Agreement  for any of the above  reasons,  all licenses  granted  hereunder
terminate and Customer will immediately destroy the Software and all copies
in any form. Upon  termination for any other reason,  Customer may continue
to use the  Software,  provided  that Sections 1, 2 (to the extent that any
amounts as owed to BroadVision as of the termination  date), 4, 6, 7, 8, 9,
and 11 shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and BroadVision may
terminate  Customer's use of the Software upon a material  breach of any of
the surviving sections.

11.  GENERAL.

A.  WAIVER/AMENDMENT.   No  waiver,   amendment,  or  modification  of  any
provision of this  Agreement  shall be effective  unless in writing and
signed  by  the  party   against  whom  such  waiver,   amendment,   or
modification  is sought to be  enforced.  No failure or delay by either
party in exercising  any right,  power or remedy under this  Agreement,
except as specifically  provided herein, shall be deemed as a waiver of
any such right, power, or remedy.

B.  ASSIGNMENT.  Either  party  may  assign  this  Agreement  to an  entity
acquiring  substantially all of its assets or merging with it, provided
that such  assignee  agree in writing to assume all  obligations  under
this Agreement. Except as set forth above, neither party may assign any
of its rights or delegate any of its  obligations  under this Agreement
to any third party  without the express  written  consent of the other.
Any attempted  assignment  in violation of the foregoing  shall be void
and of no effect. Subject to the above, this Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the  benefit  of the  successors  and  assigns of the
parties hereto.

C.  DISPUTES.  The rights of the parties hereunder shall be governed by the
laws of the State of California  without giving effect to principles of
conflicts of laws.  Any suits  brought  hereunder may be brought in the
federal or state courts in Santa Clara County, California, and Customer
submits to the jurisdiction thereof. The parties expressly exclude  the
application of the 1980 United Nations  Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods, if applicable.  Customer acknowledges that
the Software  contains  trade  secrets,  the  disclosure of which would
cause substantial harm to BroadVision that could not be remedied by the
payment of damages alone. Accordingly,  BroadVision will be entitled to
preliminary and permanent  injunctive relief and other equitable relief
for any breach of  BroadVision's  intellectual  property  rights in the
Software.

D.  SEVERABILITY.  If any  provision of this  Agreement  shall be held by a
court of competent  jurisdiction  to be contrary to law, the  remaining
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.


Page 5 of 6
<PAGE>

E.  EXPORT.  Customer  acknowledges  that the laws and  regulations  of the
United States restrict the export of the Software. Customer agrees that
it will not export or re-export  the Software in any form without first
obtaining  the  appropriate   United  States  and  foreign   government
approvals.

F.  NOTICE. Any notice,  consent, or other communication hereunder shall be
in writing, and shall be given personally,  by confirmed fax or express
delivery to either party at their respective addresses:

San Rafael, CA 94901-5529
Attn: Legal Department

or such other address as may be designated by written  notice of either
party. Notices shall be deemed given when delivered or transmitted,  or
seven days after deposit in the mail.

G.  INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. The parties' relationship shall be solely that
of independent contractor and nothing contained in this Agreement shall
be construed to make either party an agent, partner, joint venturer, or
representative of the other for any purpose.

H.  FORCE MAJEURE. If the performance of this Agreement,  or any obligation
hereunder, except the making of payments, is prevented,  restricted, or
interfered with by reason of any act or condition beyond the reasonable
control of the affected  party,  the party so affected  will be excused
from  performance  to the extent of such  prevention,  restriction,  or
interference.

I.  ENTIRE  AGREEMENT.  This Agreement,  including all Attachments  hereto,
constitutes  the complete and exclusive  agreement  between the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all proposals,
oral,   or  written,   all   previous   negotiations,   and  all  other
communications  between the parties with respect to the subject  matter
hereof. The terms of this Agreement shall prevail  notwithstanding  any

BROADVISION LICENSING PRACTICES


BroadVision's  current  standard  licensing  practices  are as  follows  for the
products listed below. These practices are in effect as of June 15, 1999.

-     ONE-TO-ONE  DEVELOPMENT  SYSTEM -- licensed on a per-user  basis. In
other words, each individual who will use the One-To-One Development
System  to  develop  BroadVision  One-To-One  applications  must  be
separately  licensed.  Customer may reassign One-To-One  Development
System  licenses within reason,  for example as employees  terminate
employment or transfer to other departments.  One-To-One Development
System products include:

-     ENTERPRISE  DEVELOPMENT  SYSTEM -- the basic BroadVision
development system

-     APPLICATION   DEVELOPMENT   SYSTEM   --   includes   the
Enterprise  Development System and the objects and other
products  necessary  to develop  ONE of the  BroadVision
Applications (Retail Commerce, Financial, or Knowledge)

-     TWO  APPLICATION  DEVELOPMENT  SYSTEM  --  same  as  the
Application  Development  System,  but  for  TWO  of the
BroadVision  Applications  (NOTE:  Business  Commerce by
itself  is  counted  as a  Two  Application  Development
System)

-     THREE  APPLICATION  DEVELOPMENT  SYSTEM  --  same as the
Application  Development  System,  but for  THREE of the
BroadVision Applications

-     ONE-TWO-ONE  DEPLOYMENT  SYSTEM -- licensing is based on the maximum
number of  Profiled  Users  permitted  to be tracked by  BroadVision
One-To-One applications.  A Profiled User corresponds to a record in
the  BroadVision  user  profile   database.   The  record  maintains
information  about the  user's  profile  and may  refer to  external
sources for additional profile  information.  The number of Profiled
Users  represents  the  number  of  one-to-one   relationships  that
Customer wants to maintain with its users.  By licensing a number of
profiled  users the  customer  is paying  for the right to keep that
many records in the BroadVision  user profile  database at any point
in time. Examples of Profiled Users include,  but are not limited to
customers, partners and employees.

-     ONE-TO-ONE  TOOLS --  licensed on a per-user  basis,  similar to the
One-To-One Development System products. One-To-One Tools include:

-     ONE-TO-ONE COMMAND CENTER, formerly known as the Dynamic
Command Center, or DCC

-     ONE-TO-ONE  PUBLISHING  CENTER,  formerly  known  as the
Content Management Center, or CMC

-     ONE-TO-ONE INSTANT PUBLISHER

-     ONE-TO-ONE  DESIGN CENTER,  formerly known as the Visual
Design Center, or VDC

[NOTE:  The One-To-One  Command  Center,  the One-To-One  Publishing
Center,  and the One-To-One  Instant Publisher may be sublicensed to
third parties using  Customer's  application  software in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement.]

professional   services,   but  not  materials  and  out-of-pocket  expenses
reasonably required for contract performance. BroadVision is not required to
continue  performance beyond the funding limitation set forth therein unless
and until  Customer  shall have  notified  BroadVision  in writing that such
funding  limitation  has been  increased  and shall have  specified  in such
notice a revised estimated  charge.  When and to the extent that the funding
limitation set forth has been increased, any charges incurred by BroadVision
in  excess  of the  funding  limitation  prior  to  the  increase  shall  be
allowable,  due and  payable  to the same  extent  as if such  charges  were
incurred after such increase in the estimated charge and funding limitation.

3.  CHANGES.

Changes shall be made in writing and signed by authorized representatives of
Customer  and  BroadVision.  All such  changes  shall  specify  the  changes
ordered, any increases in the estimated charges for performance,  adjustment
to the  schedule  of  performance,  and  any  changes  to  other  terms  and
conditions as may be effected thereby.

4.  TITLE.

BroadVision  shall  have  title  to  the  software,   systems  design,   and
documentation  arising out of  performance  or delivery to Customer  under a
Statement of Work. The parties  acknowledge that performance  thereunder may
result in the development of new concepts,  software,  methods,  techniques,
processes,  adaptations,  and ideas,  in  addition  to  BroadVision's  prior
technology  which may be  incorporated  in  BroadVision's  performance.  The
parties agree that the same shall belong to BroadVision  exclusively without
regard to the origin  thereof.  With  respect to all such  software,  system
design  information and documentation  delivered to or disclosed to Customer
pursuant to the  Statement  of Work  (""Application  Software""),  BroadVision
hereby grants to Customer, as of the time that any such Application Software
is  disclosed  to  Customer  by or on behalf of  BroadVision,  a license  in
respect of the software so disclosed.  Unless otherwise agreed to in writing

non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to use the Application
Software in  conjunction  with the  Software and for any use of the Software
permitted by this Agreement;  provided,  that for purposes of the foregoing,
the term ""use""  shall  include the right for  Customer to create  derivative
works  from  the  Application  Software  for  use in  conjunction  with  the
Software.

SUPPORT POLICIES

BROADVISION SUPPORT POLICY

BroadVision endeavors to provide a high level of support, and offers a number of
support  packages  designed to meet the needs of its diverse customer base. This
document outlines BroadVision ""Basic Support.""

The  Basic   Support   package   uses  a  case   tracking   procedure  to  track
customer-reported  problems.  Using this system,  BroadVision  support engineers
open  cases in the  order  in which  they are  received.  Cases  have  different
priorities and will be treated  accordingly.  Standard  support is provided from
9am to 6pm PT in  America,  and 9am to 6pm GMT in Europe.  If a case hasn't been
opened  after 1 day,  the Support  manager  will be  notified.  After 2 days the
Support Director will be notified.

CASE ESCALATION AND 'HOT SITE' STATUS

The  support  engineer  opening a case will set case  priority.  A customer  may
request that a case be escalated at any time by contacting the Support  engineer
or the Support Manager.

Unusually  important site problems will be considered 'hot sites'. This includes
such issues as serious reliability problems or significant  performance problems
on production systems. To escalate a case, the customer may notify their Support
engineer  or the  Support  Manager.  A 'hot  site'  will  gain  Executive  level
attention  and all  necessary  resources  to  resolve  the issue as  quickly  as
possible.

A hot site will have a dedicated  Support  engineer  until it is  resolved.  The
customer  is  expected  to  provide  technical  resources,   remote  access  and
reproducible cases as necessary.  BroadVision will manage a list of issues to be
resolved in the  escalation  to be  communicated  daily by the assigned  Support
engineer. Once all the issues are resolved, the escalation to 'hot site' will be
closed.

PRIORITY 1

The highest  level is reserved for site-down  type  failures.  Once  BroadVision
support is notified that a site is down they will start work to restore the site
as soon as possible.  If a site is not restored  after 4 hrs of work the Support
engineer will move the site to 'hot site'  status.  The WPSO engineer who worked
on the site will be contacted and Support Director notified of escalation. After
1 day of escalation VP WPSO and VP  Engineering  will be notified.  The VPs will
identify additional resources to work on the problem. After 2 days of escalation
the CEO will be notified.

PRIORITY 2

Level 2 is for serious problems on a site not causing total failure, BroadVision
Support will start work on the site as soon as they are aware of the problem. If
a  workaround  has not been  developed  after 1 day of work by Support  then the
Support  Director  will be  notified.  After  3 days  of  work  VP  WPSO  and VP
Engineering will be notified.

PRIORITY 3

The third level is for general issues on a site not causing serious problems. If
a case isn't resolved after 2 days the Support Manager will be notified. After 3
days the Support Director will be notified.


Page 1 of 3
<PAGE>
Attachment E

PRIORITY 4

The lowest level is for  questions or issues on a site not  requiring  immediate
action.  If a case  isn't  resolved  after 3 days the  Support  Manager  will be
notified. After 5 days the Support Director will be notified.

AFTER-HOURS SUPPORT

An optional  support package (not included with the Customer's  initial package)
is available to provide  support 7 days a week, 24 hrs a day for assistance with
serious   problems   on   live-sites.    It   will   not   support   development
questions/issues.  Customers  with this support  will be provided  with a single
pager number to contact the on-call  Support  person in the case of a priority 1
support call. It is preferred that the customer must provide  BroadVision dialup
access to the site in order to for support to able to provide  assistance in the
recovery process. The Support engineer on call will have a laptop so that he/she
can then dial into the website and help effect system recovery.

DOCUMENTING KNOWN PROBLEMS

BroadVision has a policy of sharing bug lists with  customers.  The intent is to
pro-actively   let  the  customers   know  about  known  problems  and  document
workarounds. BroadVision Support, Engineering and Product Management will decide
which problems to report.

Today we publish some of this  information in the Known Problems  section of the
Release Notes. The following is our policy of enhancing this information as well
as  updating  the known bugs every  month and making it  available  through  the
support section of the BroadVision web site.

1.  Currently we provide the following information in the Known Problems section
of the Release Notes. The Release Notes will be updated upon every release.

Bug Information: problem ID, brief description, any known workaround

2.  Starting  with  version  4.1  Technical  Support  will update the Known Bugs
section to include known bugs reported since the last release.  This will be
updated  once a month.  Since  the  updates  will be  written  by  Technical
Support, it will be directed to an engineering  audience. At product release
time, Tech Pubs will roll them into the formal Release Notes.

3.  We will also make the  following  patch  information  available  on our Tech
support site:

Patch Number:

Date released:  [can also list those in preparation,  with a planned release
date]
Required previous patches:  [patch numbers or 'none']
Resolved problems: [list of problem numbers]

release.  If there are specific  features  that need to be included to satisfy a
project need,  please  include that  information in the ER when  submitted,  and
email the appropriate Product Manager.

COMPATIBILITY POLICY

This section clarifies  BroadVision's policy on compatibility between production
releases. BV will provide a migration path between the objects,  templates,  and
scripts,  components  and content that  customers have created with a production
release of One-To-One to the next production  release of One-To-One.  Addressing
these in turn:

1.  BroadVision  Standard  objects - if we change the tag syntax of BV  standard
objects we will provide tools and procedures needed to migrate those objects
from one release to the next. This will provide migration path for templates
using BV standard objects.

2.  BroadVision  Standard components - if we change the signature of BV standard
components we will provide tools and  procedures  needed to migrate  scripts
from one release to the next.  This will provide  migration path for scripts
using BV standard components.

3.  BroadVision  APIs - we  will  in  general  maintain  backward  compatibility
between  BroadVision APIs. In cases, where this is not possible or desirable
we will provide tools and procedures to migrate the APIs.  This will provide
migration path for custom dynamic objects that use our APIs.

4.  Database - when we make schema  changes we will provide  migration  tools to
update  the  older  schema  and  content  from  one  production  release  of
One-To-One to the next.

Please note that we do not guarantee compatibility between Beta and FCS versions
of any given release.  However, we will strive to not have major API, tag-syntax
or schema changes between Beta and FCS releases.

If  you   have   any   questions   or   suggestions   please   send   email   to
bv-pm@broadvision.com.

BROADVISION PRODUCTS
YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE

STATEMENT OF YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE

BroadVision  One-To-one Version 4 products are year 2000 compliant.  BroadVision
One-To-One  Version 3.0 products with the applicable  year 2000 patches are year
2000 compliant.  Both versions require year 2000 compliant  hardware,  operating
systems,  databases,  compilers and other related components.  Versions prior to
3.0 have not been tested for year 2000 compliance.

This representation is with respect to BroadVision's  products only and is not a
representation  or warranty that  software  applications  developed  using these
products are or will be year 2000 compliant.  Since there are many  interrelated
dependencies in complex systems,  it is the licensee's  responsibility to ensure
that their  applications,  including those built using  BroadVision's  products,
have  undergone the level of testing and  certification  that is  appropriate to
ensure year 2000 compliance.

DEFINITION OF YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE

Year 2000 compliant means accurately processing date/time data,  including,  but
not limited to, calculating,  comparing, and sequencing, from, into, and between
the twentieth and twenty-first  centuries,  and between the years 1999 and 2000,
including  recognizing  the  year  2000 as a leap  year.  Year  2000  compliance
requires  that all  interfacing  applications  and  systems  provide and receive
date/time data in a consistent format.

CONFORMANCE TO BSI DEFINITION

BroadVision  products  adhere to the definition  set forth in DISC  PD2000-1,  A
Definition of Year 2000 Conformity Requirements, by British Standards
Institution Committee. The definition states:

RULE 1. No  value  for  current  date  will  cause  any  interruption  in
operation.

RULE 2. Date-based functionality must behave consistently for dates prior
to, during and after year 2000.

RULE 3. In all interfaces and data storage,  the century in any date must
be  specified   either   explicitly  or  by  unambiguous   algorithms  or
inferencing rule

RULE 4. Year 2000 must be recognized as a leap year.

Accordingly, the parties agree as follows:
AGREEMENT


1.	Software, License and Ownership.

a.
Software. “Software” shall mean the software in object code form specified in Exhibit A to this Agreement or any subsequent order form executed by both parties pursuant to this Agreement that substantially contains the
information set forth in Exhibit A (each an “Order Form”).
b. License Grant. Subject to the terms of this Agreement,

additional terms set forth therein (which shall take precedence and control over any conflicting terms of this Section).
c.
Restrictions. Licensee shall not (and shall not allow any end user or third party to) (i) decompile, disassemble, or otherwise reverse engineer the Software or attempt to discover any source code or underlying ideas or algorithms of the
Software, (ii) remove any product identification, copyright or other notices embedded within the Software, (iii) modify or create a derivative work of the Software (except as otherwise expressly authorized by Guidewire in writing),
(iv) remove or export any Software from the United States in violation of applicable laws or regulations, (v) relicense, provide, lease or lend the Software to any third party, or use the Software for timesharing or service bureau
purposes, (vi) copy the Software or any portion thereof except as provided herein, or (vii) disclose any performance information or analysis (including, without limitation, benchmarks) from any source relating to the Software.

d. Ownership. As between the parties, Guidewire shall retain all rights, title and interest in and to the Software including all modifications,
derivative works or improvements, and all related intellectual property rights. Customer shall retain all rights, title and interest in and to Customer’s claim, policy and other data.
e. Embedded Software. Licensee acknowledges that third party software may be embedded or otherwise delivered with the Software. Licensee may only
use such third party software as integrated with and part of the Software. The licensors of the third party software are intended beneficiaries of this Agreement, as it pertains to Licensee’s rights to use such software.
f. Intellectual Property Rights. Guidewire represents and warrants to Licensee that it has the unencumbered right to grant the license granted herein and
that there is no claim relating to the Software based on actual or alleged violation of the intellectual property rights of any other person pending or threatened against Guidewire.


2.	Fees and Payment.

a. Fees. Licensee shall
pay Guidewire all license fees (“License Fees”), support and maintenance fees (“Support Fees”) and other fees as set forth in the applicable Order Form. Unless, otherwise set forth in the applicable Order Form, Licensee shall pay
all invoices in full within thirty (30) days of the date of receipt of the invoice.
b. Late Fees. Licensee will pay a late fee
of one percent (1%) per month or the highest rate allowed under the law, whichever is lower, on any overdue amounts.







c. Review. During the term of this Agreement and for one (1) year thereafter, Licensee grants
Guidewire the right, at Guidewire expense and no more than once per year, after providing to Licensee not less than ten (10) days prior written notice, to examine Licensee’s records and other information relating to the Licensee’s use
of the Software, provided that such examination is conducted in a manner that is not disruptive to Licensee’s business. If this examination reveals that Licensee has not paid any fees due, then License agrees to promptly pay such fees. If the
underpaid fees exceed five percent (5%) of the fees actually paid for the applicable period, then Licensee shall also pay Guidewire’s reasonable costs of conducting the examination. Additionally, at Guidewire’s written request, not
more frequently than annually, Licensee shall furnish Guidewire with a signed certificate verifying that Licensee is using the Software within the terms of this Agreement.
3. Maintenance and Support. In consideration for Licensee’s payment of the Support Fees specified in the applicable Order Form, if any, Guidewire will provide support and maintenance services for the

existence as of the Effective Date, U.S. copyright or trademark rights or misappropriates a trade secret of any third party; provided that Guidewire shall have no obligation under this Section to the extent any claim of infringement or
misappropriation results solely from (i) use of the Software in combination with any other hardware or software supplied by any third person or entity other than Guidewire Dependant Products covered in Exhibit B, Section 7.; (ii) any
alteration or modification of the Software not provided or authorized by Guidewire; or (iii) use of the Software in a way not intended by Guidewire or not provided for or described in the applicable Documentation, if such infringement would not

b. Licensee shall defend or settle at its expense any Action against Guidewire, and each of its directors, officers, agents, employees and sublicensees
to the fullest extent permitted by law, arising out of or in connection with or related to any of the foregoing Indemnification Exceptions.
c. As an express condition to the foregoing indemnity obligations, the party seeking indemnity shall (i) promptly notify the indemnifying party in writing of any such actual or threatened loss, suit, claim, liability, expense or

Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any rights, licenses or obligations hereunder, may be assigned by Licensee, by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of Guidewire, provided that Licensee’s parent
corporation and any corporate affiliates controlled by such parent shall have the right to use the Software in the United States, subject to all of the provisions of this Agreement; and provided further, that such approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld. It shall be deemed unreasonable for Guidewire to withhold consent where a requested assignment does not increase the use of the Software (e.g., a transaction which does not result in combining Licensee’s insurance operations with
additional insurance operations). Licensee shall be responsible for any breach of this agreement by such parties. Guidewire may assign this Agreement in whole or in part. Any attempted assignment in violation of this Agreement shall be void and
without effect. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will benefit and bind the parties’ successors and assigns.
c. Escrow.
Upon Licensee’s written request, Guidewire shall place the source code for the Software into escrow with EscrowTech International, Inc. for the benefit of Licensee, subject to Licensee’s execution of (and the terms and conditions of)

e. Relationship of the Parties. The parties hereto expressly understand and agree that
each party is an independent contractor in the performance of each and every part of this Agreement, is solely responsible for all of its employees and agents and its labor costs and expenses arising in connection therewith. Neither party nor its
agents or employees are the representatives of the other party for any purpose and neither party has the power or authority as agent, employee or any other capacity to represent, act for, bind or otherwise create or assume any obligation on behalf
of the other party for any purpose whatsoever.
f. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including the exhibits hereto, contains the
entire understanding of the parties with respect to the matters contained herein and supersedes all prior agreements or discussions between the parties with respect to the matters contained herein.
g. Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement, and
the remaining provisions shall continue with the same effect as if such unenforceable or invalid provision had not been included in this Agreement.

instance and either retroactively or prospectively) only with the written consent of the party against whom such modification or waiver will be enforced. No terms contained in a Licensee purchase order or similar document will be binding on
Guidewire unless both parties execute the same as an addendum to this Agreement.
i. Force Majeure. Neither party shall be liable to
the other for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement if the delay or failure is due to unforeseen events, which occur after the signing of this Agreement and which are beyond the reasonable control of the parties
including but not limited to strikes, blockade, war, revolutions or riots, natural disasters, refusal of license by the government or other governmental agencies or other stipulations or restrictions by the authorities, insofar as such an event
prevents or delays the affected party from fulfilling its obligations and such party is not able to prevent or remove the force majeure at reasonable costs.

EXHIBIT A
SOFTWARE; LICENSE FEES; SUPPORT FEES AND ADDITIONAL TERMS
(Initial Order Form)
Software: Guidewire ClaimCenter is a web-based end-to-end claims management system. The modules are set forth in the Documentation and, at a high level include
the following:


•	 	 Claim Entry and Setup – provides a comprehensive set of capabilities for reporting and triaging losses. A wizard-based direct loss reporting module
allows claim handlers, call center operators, and potentially agents to enter loss information directly into ClaimCenter. Loss triage and setup module allows claim handlers to import loss notifications received via multiple channels (external call
center systems, call center outsourcers, faxed ACORD forms, etc.) and set them up properly in ClaimCenter.




•	 	 Segmentation and Assignment – provides for the segmentation and assignment of new claims and exposures. Using the newly entered loss information and the
user profiles of available adjusters as inputs, ClaimCenter determines (or prompts the user to decide upon) the appropriate claim handling strategy and adjuster.




•	 	 Claim Guidance – provides end-to-end management of all of the activities involved in the claim process. Generates a list of appropriate tasks and
assigns to various parties, primarily the adjuster owning the claim or the line. Tracks all activities to ensure that they are completed successfully. Monitors the workplan and other files in the claim record to determine when additional tasks are
necessary, and automatically creates these tasks and assigns them to the appropriate internal or external user based on task attributes and user profiles.




•	 	 Exception Based Notification and Management – provides automated escalation of overdue activities. Flagging of claims based on any criteria. Automated
exception handling.




•	 	 Claim Desktop – provides a unified view of all of each user’s work across claims. Includes activity queues, unified activity calendar, configurable
search, and ad hoc reporting with data export.




•	 	 Claim Dashboard – provides real-time views of team workload. Allows drill down through organization to individual level. Claim and exposure aging. Key
metrics for open and closed claims. Financial performance for open and closed claims.




•	 	 Claim File – provides the main repository that contains or provides pointers to all information about a claim, including basic fields for the claim and
each exposure (suffix) within the claim, claim notes, pointers to documents (including faxes, correspondence, etc.) stored in a separate imaging system or in another application, people involved (claimant, policyholder, witness, etc.), with links to
address book entries, vendors (with links to address book entries), imported policy information, tools to help evaluate a claim and manage negotiations, litigation management, association of claims to other related claims, and other features
described elsewhere (e.g. ClaimFinancials).




•	 	 ClaimFinancials – allows the execution of all standard claim transactions. Reserves are set, adjusted, and managed. Payments are created, managed, and
pass to downstream systems. Recoveries from salvage, subrogation, or unclaimed property are accepted, tracked, and optionally reserved.




•	 	 ContactCenter – provides a centralized address book for shared contact and vendor information. Includes the ability to link contacts on claims to the
central address book and to synchronize contacts between the central address book and the claim file.




•	 	 Rules Engine – externalization of most business logic in ClaimCenter, including segmentation, validation, exception, assignment, approval, and other
functions. Accessed through an installed rule composer, Guidewire Studio, with functionality for composing, versioning, testing/debugging, and searching rules.




•	 	 Other features – various other features, as specified by the documentation, are part of the product. Some examples include a spell checking interface, a
productized ISO integration, configurable search and filters, and various administration functions (e.g. add new users and groups).




•	 	 Guidewire Platform – rich set of tools and capabilities that allow for configuration, integration, bulk import of converted data, server clustering, and
much more.




•	 	 Any proprietary tools and software used in conjunction with the Licensed Software, including, but not limited to, Guidewire Studio.

1.	License and Support Fees; Exhibit Term:

Licensee shall pay the
following License Fees for an initial term of five years from the Effective Date of this Agreement (the “Initial Term”):



Initial Term License Fee Schedule


Annual Term
Support Services	  	Annual License Fees
Year 1
Included	  	$	318,815
Year 2
Included	  	$	318,815
Year 3
Included	  	$	318,815
Year 4
Included	  	$	318,815
Year 5
Included	  	$	318,815

This Exhibit shall commence on the Effective Date of the Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect for
Initial Term set forth above. This Exhibit shall automatically renew at the end of the Initial Term (and thereafter) for additional periods of twelve (12) months (each a “Renewal Term”) at Guidewire’s then-current fees (provided
that Guidewire provides notice of any increase in fees to be applicable during the next Renewal Term at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of the then-current term), unless terminated by either party by written notice no less than thirty
(30) days prior to the end of the then-current term. Solely for the purposes of this Exhibit, the Initial Term and any Renewal Term(s) are referred to as the “Exhibit Term”.
The annual License Fee for Year 1 is due on the Effective Date of the Agreement. The annual License Fees for the balance of the Exhibit Term are payable on each
applicable anniversary of the Effective Date.
Support Fees are included in the annual License Fees during the Exhibit Term. The annual License Fees are
subject to adjustments pursuant to the “Growth Rates” Sections of this Exhibit.
The License Fees in this Exhibit are based on Licensee’s
direct written premiums (“DWP”) in a calendar year of $200 Million. The level of DWP which will be the basis of calculating incremental License Fees (if any are required pursuant to the terms hereof) is subject to adjustment from time to
time as set forth in this Exhibit A based on the amount of incremental License Fees paid. Such amount as it may be adjusted from time to time is referred to herein as the “DWP Baseline.” Once the annual level of DWP has reached
$800,000,000 and Licensee has paid the appropriate fee associated with that level, then no subsequent incremental License Fees shall be imposed for any reason.
If Licensee’s DWP increases less than twenty-five percent (25%) of the then-applicable DWP Baseline, then Licensee will maintain the current License Fees and no incremental license fees will be incurred pursuant to any of the
provisions of this Exhibit. For the purposes hereof, the term “Buffer” means the amount which is 125% of the then-applicable DWP Baseline.


2.	Incremental License Fees During the Initial Term.

During the
Initial Term, incremental License Fees are only payable based on DWP growth resulting from Licensee acquiring, purchasing, or merging with any other company or entity or acquisition of assets (“Non-Organic Growth”). However, incremental
License Fees may be accrued during the Initial Term because of growth not attributable to Non-Organic Growth (“Organic Growth”) and may become payable immediately following the end of the Initial Term. Specifically, at the beginning of the
first Renewal Term, if any, or upon the exercise by Licensee of the Perpetual Buyout Option as described in Section 4 hereof, Licensee shall pay, in addition to any other amount then due, the amount of any accrued but unpaid incremental License
Fees that would have resulted during the Initial Term as a result of Licensee’s Organic Growth. The additional License Fee will be calculated using the table that appears in Section 5 hereof.


7








If during the Initial Term Licensee’s DWP exceeds the Buffer as a result of Non-Organic Growth (after netting out
any change in DWP that results from Organic Growth), then (i) Licensee will pay an annual, additional License Fee at the end of the year following Licensee’s initial use of the Licensed Software in conjunction with such added DWP resulting
from Non-Organic Growth and each succeeding year in the Initial Term and any Renewal Term(s), and (ii) for all future calculations of incremental License Fees, the amount of the DWP Baseline shall be adjusted by the amount of DWP for which
Licensee has paid incremental License Fees. Licensee agrees to report any use of the Software in conjunction with such incremental DWP resulting from Non-Organic Growth to Guidewire within thirty (30) days from initial use. The additional
License Fee will be calculated using the table that appears in Section 5 hereof.
3. Incremental License Fees During any Renewal Term.

During any Renewal Term, if Licensee’s DWP surpasses the Buffer for any reason (e.g., Non-Organic Growth or Organic Growth), then
(i) Licensee will pay an additional, annual, incremental License Fee at the end of such term and any succeeding Renewal Term following Licensee’s initial use of the Licensed Software in conjunction with such added DWP, and (ii) for
all future calculations of incremental License Fees, the amount of the DWP Baseline shall be adjusted by the amount of DWP for which Licensee has paid incremental License Fees. Licensee agrees to report any use of the Software in conjunction with
such incremental DWP to Guidewire within thirty (30) days from initial use. The incremental license fee shall apply to all DWP increases once Licensee exceeds the Buffer. The incremental license fee will be calculated using the table that
appears in Section 5 hereof.
4. Perpetual Buyout Option. At the end of the Initial Term or at the end of any Renewal Term (provided that
Licensee has paid all applicable fees during the Initial Term and any applicable Renewal Term), Licensee will have an option to make the license term perpetual by paying the amounts described in this Section 4 (the “Perpetual Buyout
Option”). Licensee may exercise its Perpetual Buyout Option at the end of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term by paying the following fees:


a.	One-time, lump sum License Fee equal to 300% of the annual fee during the last year of the term license (i.e., Year 5 of the Initial Term or the last Renewal Term) to be paid upon
exercise of the Perpetual Buyout Option, and no subsequent annual License Fees shall ever be payable.



b.	Support Services not include included in the perpetual License Fee. Licensee may purchase Support Services for the initial, annual Support Fee in an amount equal 50% the annual fee
during the last year of the term license (i.e., Year 5 of the Initial Term or the last Renewal Term).



c.	If, after Licensee exercises the Perpetual Buyout Option (the “Perpetual Term”), Licensee’s DWP surpasses the Buffer for any reason (e.g. Non-Organic Growth or
Organic Growth), then Licensee will pay a one-time incremental License Fee following Licensee’s initial use the Licensed Software in conjunction with such added DWP. Licensee agrees to report any use of the Software in conjunction with such
incremental DWP to Guidewire within thirty (30) days from initial use. The incremental license fee will be calculated using the table that appears in Section 5 hereof.



d.	If Licensee is obligated to pay an incremental License Fee as set forth above and purchases Support Services, then Licensee shall also pay incremental Support Fees equal to 20% of
such incremental License Fees. Licensee shall pay those Support Fees contemporaneously with such incremental license fee. Guidewire will prorate the incremental Support Fees for the then-current Support Services annual term.




e.	Notwithstanding any other term of the Agreement or this Exhibit, if Guidewire consents to the assignment of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.b. of the Agreement, then
Guidewire may condition such consent on the Software license being restricted to use in conjunction with the amount of Licensee’s DWP immediately prior to such assignment



8








5. Calculations of Incremental License Fees. For any calculation of any incremental license fee required pursuant
to the provisions of Sections 2, 3 or 4 hereof, such fees shall be calculated as follows:




Total DWP greater than the then-applicable DWP Baseline	  	Incremental license fee is equal to:

1st Band
but less than $300,000,000:	  	amount of DWP above the then-applicable DWP Baseline multiplied by $0.00135

2nd Band
and greater than or equal to $300,000,000 but less than $400,000,000:	  	amount of DWP above the greater of $300,000,000 or then-applicable DWP Baseline multiplied by $0.00111

3rd Band
and greater than or equal to $400,000,000 but less than $800,000,000:	  	amount of DWP above the greater of $400,000,000 or then-applicable DWP Baseline multiplied by $0.00087.

4th Band
and greater than $800,000,000:	  	no additional incremental fee is due

In making the calculations pursuant to the above table, if the applicable DWP is in a higher numbered band than
the band of the then-applicable DWP Baseline, then the incremental license fee will be the sum of the amounts determined with respect to each applicable lower-numbered band and the band of the DWP.

EXHIBIT B
MAINTENANCE AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES


1.	SUPPORT SERVICES. Support Services consist of (a) E-Mail Support and Telephone Support provided to designated Licensee technical support contact(s) concerning the installation,
use, and resolution of Issues relating to Supported Releases of the Software, and (b) the provision of any Updates at no additional cost to Licensee. Licensee may designate up to four (4) Licensee technical support contacts to request
Support Services. All Licensee support contacts must be trained in the use of Software. Guidewire provides E-Mail Support and Telephone Support Monday through Friday during the following hours: 9:00 am to 8:00 pm EST (Eastern Standard Time),
excluding holidays. In addition, Guidewire provides support 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, for Severity Level 1 issues only.



2.	DEFINITIONS.



2.1.	“Dependent Products” means the third party operating systems, databases or other third party software products with which Software was intended to inter-operate as set
forth in the Documentation.



2.2.	“Certified Dependant Products” or “Certify” means Dependant Products that Guidewire has designated for use with Supported Versions of the Software.




2.3.	“E-Mail Support” means electronically generated Support Services provided in response to electronically transmitted inquiries by Licensee.



2.4.	“Issue” means an error, question, or other issue related to Supported Releases of the Software for which Licensee needs Support Services assistance. Guidewire provides
Support Services for Issues that are reproducible a Support Release, running unaltered, and on an appropriate hardware, database and operating system configurations, as specified in the Documentation.



2.5.	“Major and Minor Releases.” Guidewire releases the Software with release numbers in the form x.y.z (e.g., 2.1.5). A “Major Release” is defined as all
releases with the same first digit in the release number; for example, 2.0.0, 2.0.1 and 2.1.0 are all part of the same Major Release. A “Minor Release” is defined as all releases with the same first and second digits in the release
number; for example, 2.1.0, 2.1.1, and 2.1.2 are all part of the same Minor Release. A “Maintenance Release” is defined as an individual release with a unique combination of three digits in the release number; for example, 2.1.5 is a
Maintenance Release.



2.6.	“Supported Release” means a Major, Minor or Maintenance Release for which Guidewire provides Support Services as set forth in this Section. Guidewire will support all
releases within a given Major Release for twelve months after general availability of the first subsequent Major Release. For example, Guidewire will support all 2.x.y releases for twelve months after 3.0.0 is generally
available. Guidewire will also support the last Maintenance Releases within a Major Release until the second subsequent Major Release is generally available. Continuing the previous example, if 2.1.5 is the last Maintenance Release within
the 2.x.y Major Release, then Guidewire will support 2.1.5 until 4.0.0 is generally available.



2.7.	“Telephone Support” means Support Services telephone assistance provided by Guidewire to the Licensee technical support contact concerning the installation and use of the
Software.



2.8.	“Update(s)” means revisions to the Software that correct defects, errors or bugs or incorporate minor enhancements to the functionality that Guidewire in its discretion
makes generally available to its customers who subscribe to Support Services in the form of Major Releases, Minor Releases and Maintenance Releases. Guidewire will notify Licensee of all Updates available for the Software licensed by Licensee.
Guidewire will make such Updates and corresponding Documentation available to Licensee at no additional cost.



3.	SUPPORT SERVICES REQUESTS. Licensee shall use the methods described in Section 1 above to engage Guidewire Support Services. Guidewire will use commercially reasonable efforts
to resolve Issues. Guidewire may use any reasonable resolution method available (e.g. fixes, workarounds, etc.) to resolve an Issue. Guidewire will classify and respond to reported Issues according to the Severity Levels and response periods set
forth in Schedule A to this Exhibit. Guidewire does not guarantee resolution to Issues within the response period, only response to initial calls. Failure to contact a Licensee within the response time period because the Licensee is unavailable
(e.g. phone busy, no answer, in a meeting, or out of the office) does not constitute Guidewire’s noncompliance with the response commitment.



4.	 NON-GUIDEWIRE ISSUES. If Guidewire reasonably believes that a problem reported by Licensee may not be due to an Issue related to the Software, Guidewire will notify
Licensee. At that time, Licensee may (1) instruct Guidewire to proceed





10










with Issue determination at Licensee’s possible expense as set forth below, or (2) instruct Guidewire that Licensee does not wish the Issue
pursued. If Licensee requests that Guidewire proceed with Issue determination at Licensee’s possible expense and Guidewire reasonably determines that the issue was not due to an Issue in the Software, Licensee shall pay Guidewire’s
then-current and standard consulting rates for all work performed in connection with such determination, plus reasonable and necessary related expenses incurred therewith. Licensee shall not be liable for (i) Issue determination or repair to
the extent problems are due to an Issue in the Software, (ii) work performed under this paragraph in excess of Licensee’s instructions, or (iii) work performed after Licensee has notified Guidewire that it no longer wishes work on the
Issue determination to be continued at its possible expense (such notice shall be deemed given when actually received by Guidewire).




5.	WHAT IS NOT INCLUDED UNDER SUPPORT SERVICES.



5.1.	Training. Support Services do not cover in-depth training. If training in the use of the Software will take more than thirty minutes of a support engineer’s time,
Guidewire will refer Licensee to implementation services. Guidewire provides implementation services are on a time and materials basis at Licensee’s request.



5.2.	Assistance in the configuration of the Software. Support Services do not include assistance in developing Licensee’s specific configuration requirements. Depending upon
the nature and complexity of the consulting request, Guidewire will refer Licensee to Guidewire implementation services.



5.3.	Information and assistance on technical issues related to the installation, administration, and use of enabling technologies such as databases, computer networks, and
communications. Guidewire does not provide these services.



5.4.	Assistance with the installation and configuration of hardware including, but not limited to computers, hard disks, networks, and printers. Guidewire does not provide these
services.



5.5.	Support Services for Non-Supported Releases. Guidewire only provides Support Services for Supported Releases. Licensee may request Support Services for a non-supported
release on a time and materials basis.



5.6.	Modified versions of the Software. Unless previously approved by Guidewire in writing, Guidewire shall have no obligation to support: (i) any portion of the Software
that has been modified; or (ii) Issues caused by use of Software other than as specified or contemplated in the Documentation.



6.	REPRODUCING ERRORS. In order to resolve an Issue, Guidewire must be able to reproduce the Issue. Both parties will use reasonable efforts to reproduce the Issue. Guidewire provides

paid by Customer under this Agreement.

ARTICLE 10: CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WAIVER

EXCEPT FOR A BREACH OF ARTICLE 2 OR ARTICLE 8 BY CUSTOMER, IN NO EVENT SHALL
EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR SPECIAL

PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED AS TO THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

ARTICLE 11: GENERAL

11.1 Force Majeure. Except with respect to the Customer's obligation to make

elements, labor disputes, government requirements, civil or military
authorities, acts of God or by the public enemy, inability to secure raw
materials or transportation facilities, acts or omissions of carriers or

this Agreement. Customer agrees that the Licensed Software is and will remain
after termination of this Agreement the valuable, proprietary, and confidential
property of LICENSOR, that any violation of Article 8 would cause LICENSOR
irreparable injury for which it would have no adequate remedy at law, and that
LICENSOR will be entitled to preliminary and other injunctive relief against any
such violation. Such injunctive relief will be in addition to, and in no way
limitation of, any other remedies or rights that LICENSOR may have at law or in
equity.

11.6  No Waiver. No course of dealing, course of performance, or failure of
either party strictly to enforce any term, right or condition of this
Agreement shall be construed as a waiver of any other term, right or
condition. No waiver or breach of any provision of this Agreement shall be
construed to be a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same of any
provision.

11.7  Relationship of the Parties.  Licensor and Customer are independent
contractors.

11.8  Fax Signatures. The parties hereby agree that signatures transmitted and
received via facsimile or other electronic means shall be treated for all

FUTURE MILESTONES

a. Semotus shall sell to Innofone certain assets consisting of its HipLinkXS and
Clickmarks software application products (the ""Asset Sale"") if the following
conditions are met. In consideration, Innofone shall pay five thousand dollars
($5,000) to Semotus within ten (10) days of full execution of this License
Agreement, two hundred forty five thousand dollars ($245,000) within ninety days
of full execution of this License Agreement, and Innofone shall issue to Semotus
a five hundred thousand dollar ($500,000) convertible promissory note. Innofone
must have one million dollars ($1,000,000) in operating cash at the time of the
closing of the Asset Sale and have resolved any pending litigation (carve out
for Caleum) prior to the close of the Asset Sale. Semotus shall have approval
authority regarding any material Innofone transaction during the period
commencing upon the payment of the $5,000 and continuing thereafter until the
close of the Asset Sale, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld.

Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment. In the event that the value of the
Shares following the Closing Date is less than $3.75 million, then and in that
event, the Post Closing Purchase Price Adjustment will be triggered. If the Post
Closing Purchase Price Adjustment is triggered, during each calendar month after
Closing and until the Asset Sale is Closed, Innofone shall promptly deliver
additional shares of its common stock such that Semotus shall have an aggregate
number of shares of Innofone common stock with an aggregate market value as of
the date of payment of no less than Three Million Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand
and 00/100 Dollars ($3,750,000) (""POST-CLOSING PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT"").
Failure to deliver additional shares within 5 business days after month end will
result in termination of ""Asset Sale"" agreement.

Closing Contingencies:
1.   The appropriate legal documentation and definitive agreements relating
to the Asset Sale having been fully agreed upon by both parties and
fully executed; and
2.   Completion of Due Diligence, the approval by each party's Board of
Directors, and Shareholder approval.

b.   Upon the close of the Asset Sale, Semotus shall grant to Innofone a Right
of First Refusal to merge with and into Semotus (the ""Merger""). The Right
of First Refusal is conditional upon the following factors: (i) Innofone
must have at least four million dollars ($4,000,000) in net shareholder
value, and (ii) Innofone must have at least two million dollars
($2,000,000) in operating cash. Net shareholder value means shareholders'
equity, as determined by the American Stock Exchange listing requirements.

Right of First Refusal. During the time period beginning from the Closing Date
of the Asset Sale and ending ninety (90) calendar days thereafter (the
""Restricted Period""), Innofone shall have a right of first refusal with respect
to any proposed merger undertaken by Semotus, as follows. In the event that,
during the Restriction Period, Semotus proposes to merge with another entity (a
""Proposed Transaction""), then Semotus shall send to Innofone notice in writing
of all of the terms of the Proposed Transaction (such notice, the ""Offer
Notice""). The Offer Notice shall constitute an irrevocable offer to merge with
Innofone, on a basis similar to that described in the Proposed Transaction.

At any time within five (5) calendar days after receipt by Innofone of the Offer
Notice (the ""Option Period""), Innofone may elect to accept the offer to merge
with Semotus under similar terms of the Proposed Transaction and shall give
written notice of such election, including all of the terms of the Innofone
Proposed Transaction (the ""Acceptance Notice"") to Semotus within the Option
Period.

Page 13
<PAGE>

Semotus' Board of Directors shall then determine, in its sole discretion, which
merger transaction (the Proposed Transaction or the Innofone Proposed
Transaction) is in the best interests of Semotus and its shareholders. The
closing for any merger with Innofone shall take place within thirty (30) days
following the expiration of the Option Period. After the expiration of the
Option Period, if Innofone has not provided to Semotus an Acceptance Notice for
the merger under identical terms of the Proposed Transaction, then Semotus may
offer such merger on similar terms to third parties. However, in the course of
negotiation with third parties, if the terms of the Proposed Transaction are
materially modified, then Semotus shall again send an Offer Notice to Innofone
outlining any such material modification of the Proposed Transaction (the
""Revised Transaction"") and shall grant Innofone a new Offering Period in which
to accept such Revised Transaction.

Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment. In the event that the value of the
Shares following the Closing Date is less than $3.75 million, then and in that
event, the Post Closing Purchase Price Adjustment will be triggered. If the Post
Closing Purchase Price Adjustment is triggered, during each calendar month after
Closing and until the Merger is Closed, Innofone shall promptly deliver
additional shares of its common stock such that Semotus shall have an aggregate
number of shares of Innofone common stock with an aggregate market value as of
the date of payment of no less than Three Million Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand
and 00/100 Dollars ($3,750,000) (""POST-CLOSING PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT"").

Closing Contingencies:
1.   The appropriate legal documentation and definitive agreements relating
to the Merger having been fully agreed upon by both parties and fully
executed; and
2.   The approval by each party's Board of Directors, shareholders and the
American Stock Exchange.

c. Innofone shall have the right to buy back the Shares in cash at the
Transaction Price ($3,750,000) should the Merger not close. This buy back option
will be valid for one year from the full execution of this License Agreement.

unaltered version provided by Portal, if infringement would have been avoided by
a current unaltered version; or (B) combination, operation or use of the
Licensed Software with software and/or hardware not delivered by Portal if such

trade secrets and each party agrees that it shall use the Confidential
Information of the other party solely in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement and it will not disclose, or permit to be disclosed, the same directly

advisors and/or substantial potential investors having a reasonable need to
know, having no reasonably anticipated conflict of interest with the other
Party, and under a contractual or professional duty to maintain the
confidentiality of the terms and conditions disclosed thereto. Each party agrees

unauthorized use and disclosure. However, neither party bears any responsibility
for safeguarding any information that it can document in writing (a) is in the

opportunity to respond or object to the disclosure or if prior notice is not
permitted or practical under the circumstances, prompt notice of such
disclosure. In the event of actual or threatened breach of the provisions of
Section 4 or Section 17, the non-breaching party will be entitled to seek
immediate injunctive and other equitable relief, without waiving any other

19    MISCELLANEOUS
19.1    Neither party will incur any liability to the other on account of any
loss or damage resulting from any delay or failure to perform all or any part of

events, occurrences, or causes beyond its control and without negligence of the
parties. Such events, occurrences or causes will include, without limitation,
acts of God, strikes, lockouts, riots, acts of war, earthquakes, fire and
explosions, but the ability to meet financial obligations is expressly excluded.

19.2    Any waiver of the provisions of this Agreement or of a party's rights or
remedies under this Agreement must be in writing to be effective. Failure,
neglect or delay by a party to enforce the provisions of this Agreement or its
rights or remedies at any time will not be construed to be deemed a waiver of
such party's rights under this Agreement and will not in any way affect the
validity of the whole or any part of this Agreement or prejudice such party's
right to take subsequent action.

19.3    If any term, condition or provision in this Agreement is found to be
invalid, unlawful or unenforceable to any extent, the parties shall endeavor in
good faith to agree to such amendments that will preserve, as far as possible,
the intentions expressed in this Agreement. If the parties fail to agree on such
an amendment, such invalid term, condition or provision will be severed from the
remaining terms, conditions and provisions, which will continue to be valid and
enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.

19.4    This Agreement (including the Schedules and any addenda hereto signed by
both parties) contains the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all previous communications,
representations, understandings and agreements, either oral or written, between
the parties with respect to said subject matter. No employee, agent,
representative or affiliate of Portal has authority to bind Portal to any oral
representations or warranty concerning the Licensed Software. Any written
representation or warranty not expressly contained in this Agreement is
unenforceable. This Agreement may not be modified or amended except in writing
signed by a duly authorized representative of each party. No other act,
document, usage or custom shall be deemed to amend or modify this Agreement.

19.5    No terms, provisions or conditions of any purchase order,
acknowledgement or other business form that Licensee may use in connection with
the acquisition or licensing of the Licensed Software will have any effect on
the rights, duties or obligations of the parties


Confidential                        Page 3 of 7

<PAGE>

under, or otherwise modify, this Agreement, regardless of any failure of Portal
to object to such terms, provisions, or conditions.

19.6    The parties agree to reasonably cooperate in joint marketing and public
relations activities including without limitation the issuance of a joint press
release announcing Licensee's selection of the Portal solution and participation
in Portal's Success Stories program. Licensee's public relations personnel will
have an opportunity to review and approve the final draft of any joint public
relations materials before distribution to the press. Following successful
implementation of the Licensed Software and at Portal's request, Portal shall be
permitted to conduct a brief telephone interview (not to exceed thirty minutes
without Licensee's consent) with a senior-level spokesperson within Licensee's
organization involved with the implementation of the Portal solution. Portal may
write and publish a high-level success story profile based on the interview and
discussing the reasons supporting Licensee's choice of the Portal solution and
the benefits realized by Licensee. Licensee shall have final approval over the
final content of such literature prior to initial distribution by Portal. Except
as provided in this Agreement, neither party will engage in joint public
relations activities without the prior written consent of the other party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

19.7    Licensee agrees to be a reference account for Portal and will, at
Portal's request, participate in at least four (4) telephone reference inquiries
per year and at least one (1) onsite visit per year provided that Portal shall
give Licensee reasonable advance notice of not less than (i) 48 hours in the
case of a telephone reference visit and (ii) 7 days in the case of an onsite
visit. Further, Portal shall be permitted to identify Licensee as a customer on
its customer lists and investor calls.

19.8    This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in two (2) or more
counterparts, each of which will be considered an original, but all of which
together will constitute one and the same instrument. The exchange of a fully
executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by fax shall be sufficient to
bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

19.9    Portal is an independent contractor; nothing in this Agreement shall be
construed to create a partnership, joint venture or agency relationship between
the parties.

19.10   If this license is acquired under a U. S. Government contract, use,
duplication or disclosure by the U. S. Government is subject to restrictions set
forth in FAR subparagraphs 52.227-19(a)-(d) for civilian agency contracts and
DFARS 252.227-7013(c)(ii) for Department of Defense contracts. Portal reserves
all unpublished rights under United States copyright laws.

19.11   In the event that this Agreement or the licenses granted hereunder
should ever become subject to US bankruptcy proceedings, all rights and licenses
granted under or pursuant to this Agreement by Portal to Licensee are, and shall
otherwise be deemed to be, licenses of rights to ""intellectual property"" as
defined in Section 365(n) of the Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. Section 101 et.
seq.). The parties agree that Licensee, as a licensee of such rights, shall
retain and may fully exercise all of the rights and election under Section
365(n) of the Bankruptcy Code. The parties further agree that, in the event that
any proceeding shall be instituted by or against Portal seeking to adjudicate it
bankrupt, or insolvent, or seeking liquidation, winding up, reorganization,
insolvency or reorganization, or relief of debtors, or seeking an entry of an
order of relief, or the appointment of a receiver, trustee or other similar
official for it or any substantial part of its property or it shall take any
action to authorize any of the foregoing actions, Licensee shall have the right
to retain and enforce its rights under this Agreement as provided under Section
365(n) of the Bankruptcy Code, including but not limited to, the right to
continue to use the Licensed Software in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

19.12   This Agreement will be interpreted and construed pursuant to the laws of
the State of California and the United States without regard to conflict of laws
provisions thereof, and without regard to the United Nations Convention on the
International Sale of Goods. Any legal action or proceeding relating to this
Agreement shall be instituted in a state or federal court in Santa Clara County,
California. Portal and Licensee agree to submit to the jurisdiction of, and
agree that venue is proper in, these courts in any such action or proceeding.

19.13   The prevailing party in any action to enforce this Agreement will be
entitled to recover its reasonable attorney's fees and costs in connection with
such action.

19.14   The provisions of this Agreement allocate the risks between Portal and
Licensee. Licensee's pricing reflects this allocation of risk and the limitation
of liability specified in this Agreement.

19.15   The parties have requested that this Agreement and all documents
contemplated hereby be drawn up in English.

CONFIDENTIALITY

Section 5.01 Confidentiality.

(a) Each of Visteon and the Company agrees to hold in confidence, and to
use only as permitted by this Agreement, all information that is disclosed under
this Agreement and designated by the disclosing Party in writing or by
appropriate stamp or legend as ""CONFIDENTIAL"" or some similar marking of like
importance, or where the nature of the information is such that a reasonable
person who deals with such information would believe that a party intends or is
obligated to maintain it as confidential (hereinafter ""Confidential
Information""). For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that Confidential
Information shall include information of third party licensors that is
designated as confidential under the terms of an agreement between Visteon and
such third party licensor provided that such information is designated by the
disclosing Party in writing or by appropriate stamp or legend as ""CONFIDENTIAL""
or some similar marking of like importance. The receiving Party agrees to use
the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable degree of care, to
prevent the unauthorized use and disclosure of the Confidential Information to
third parties (including Ford) as it uses to protect its own confidential
information of like importance.

(b) To the extent that any third-party licensor of any Licensed Visteon
Third Party Software or Licensed Services Software to be disclosed or made
available to the Company in connection with the licenses granted herein or the
performance of the Services requires the Company to execute a non-disclosure
agreement as a condition of its consent to use of the same for the benefit of
the Company or to grant the Company access to such Software, the Company


8
<PAGE>
agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate and execute an
acceptable non-disclosure agreement with such third-party.

(c) Except as specified below, the obligations of this Article 5 shall
terminate on the expiration or termination of the Master Services Agreement,
after which the party having received the Confidential Information shall limit
further disclosure in the same manner as that party protects its own
confidential information of like importance.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the obligations
of restricted disclosure and use specified herein will not apply to Confidential
Information which: (i) is available as of the Effective Time or becomes
available to the public without breach of this Agreement; (ii) is authorized for
release in writing by the disclosing Party prior to the applicable disclosure;
(iii) is lawfully obtained from a third party or parties without a duty of
confidentiality; (iv) is disclosed to a third party by the disclosing Party
without a similar duty of confidentiality; or (v) is at any time developed by
the receiving Party independently of any related disclosure(s) from the
disclosing Party.

(e) With regard to any Confidential Information disclosed pursuant to this
Agreement, the receiving Party shall not be liable for unauthorized disclosure
of such Confidential Information pursuant to judicial action or governmental
regulations or requirements, provided that the receiving Party notifies the
disclosing Party of the need for such disclosure within a reasonable period of
time before such disclosure is required.

Section 5.02 Certain Disclosures to Third Parties.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Article 5, and provided it
is not otherwise restricted under this Agreement, disclosure of Confidential
Information by a licensed party under this Agreement to a third party will be
permitted only to the extent necessary to carry out the license grants herein,
and only after such third party agrees to adhere to confidentiality provisions
at least as restrictive as those adhered to by the licensee under this Agreement
and to use such Confidential Information only to provide products to, or
purchase products from, the licensee herein.

(b) With respect to Confidential Information that includes software of the
type embedded in a product or associated tools, disclosure by a licensee under
this Agreement to a third party will be permitted only to the extent necessary
to carry out the license grants herein, and further provided that such third
party agrees to: protect such software for a period of at least five (5) years
from date of disclosure; use such Confidential Information only to provide
products to, or design, test and manufacture products for, or purchase products
from, the licensed party herein; and limit access to its employees having a need
to use such Confidential Information to provide products to, or design, test and
manufacture products for, or purchase products from, the licensed party herein.

(c) In no event shall a licensee disclose Confidential Information or other
intellectual property owned or licensed by a third party to the extent such
disclosure would violate any applicable license agreement or applicable trade
secret or copyright or other Laws.

observed Ford/Visteon holiday.

ARTICLE 7.
MISCELLANEOUS

Section 7.01 Obligation to Disclose Technology.

Visteon and VGTI each agree to put forth a good faith effort to deliver
copies of all documentation and information, in addition to Manuals and
Documentation, requested by the Company as part of the Contributed Software as
necessary to give full enabling effect to the licenses granted hereunder,
provided that the Company agrees to pay for the reasonable administrative costs
for copying and delivering the requested copies of documents and information and
to comply with the confidentiality and non-disclosure requirements of third
parties. The foregoing obligation to copy and deliver the requested documents
and information shall terminate April 1, 2006.

Section 7.02 Transfer or Assignment of Software Licenses and Rights.

Notwithstanding anything in any Contribution Agreement Transaction Document
to the contrary, this Software Agreement and this Article 7 shall apply to all
transfers, assignments, licenses and sublicenses of Contributed Software and
Licensed Software between the Parties and consents required therefor. This
Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to convey, transfer, assign,
license, or sublicense any Contributed Third Party Software, Licensed Visteon
Third Party Software or Licensed Services Software (collectively ""Third Party
Software"") or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting
therefrom if such conveyance, transfer or assignment, without the consent of a
third party thereto, would constitute a breach or other contravention of any
license or other agreement between Visteon, VGTI any third party with respect to
such Third Party Software (unless such consent is obtained prior to the
Closing). Visteon and VGTI will use their best efforts, and the Company shall
cooperate as necessary, to obtain the consent of the other parties with respect
to any such Third Party Software or any claim or right or any benefit arising
thereunder for the assignment thereof to the Company (or any Subsidiary of the
Company); provided, that, except as set forth in Section 7.04 hereof, such
efforts shall not require Visteon or the Company to incur any material expenses
or Liabilities or provide any material financial accommodation or to provide a
guarantee to obtain any such consent (provided that Visteon agrees to accept a
consent notwithstanding that it does not include a release). Subject to Section
7.04, if such consent is not obtained, or if an attempted conveyance, transfer,
assignment, license or sublicense thereof would be ineffective, would adversely
affect the rights of Visteon thereunder so that the Company would not in fact
receive all such rights, or would require a material payment by the Company or
Visteon, until such consent is obtained (whereupon such Third Party Software
shall be promptly transferred by Visteon to the Company or applicable Subsidiary
of the Company pursuant to the applicable provisions of this Agreement), Visteon
and the Company will cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement under which
the Company would obtain benefits and assume obligations thereunder, including
making any required payments thereunder, in accordance with this Agreement,
including sub-contracting, sub-licensing, or sub-leasing to the Company, or
under which Visteon would enforce or operate for the benefit of the Company the
applicable Third


11
<PAGE>
Party Software and any claim, right or benefit arising thereunder. Visteon will
promptly pay to the Company when received all monies received by Visteon from
any third party under any agreement between Visteon and a third party to the
extent such monies are received with respect to any Contributed Visteon Owned
Software or any claim, right or benefit arising thereunder, except to the extent
the same represents an Excluded Asset.

Section 7.03 Inadvertent Omissions.

(a) Visteon and VGTI have used good faith efforts to identify all Software
to be transferred and licensed to the Company as required by the Contribution
Agreement. To the extent any Software or other rights are discovered or
identified at any time before or after the Closing Date which, pursuant to
Article 2 or Article 3 hereof should have been transferred or licensed to
Company but are still in Visteon's or any of Visteon's Affiliates' possession or
not listed in the Schedules herein, Visteon shall immediately transfer and
promptly deliver them (or cause them to be delivered) to the Company or include
them in the appropriate Schedules hereto.

(b) To Visteon's knowledge, the Schedules and attachments hereto include
all Software existing as of June 15, 2005 to be contributed or licensed to the
Company. The Parties agree that within ninety (90) days after Closing, they will
cooperate and identify (i) any modifications or corrections necessary to the
Schedules hereto, including, without limitation, changing the Schedule on which
Software is listed, and (ii) all other Software to be contributed or licensed to
the Company pursuant to this Agreement that is identified between June 15, 2005
and Closing. The Parties agree that such Software will be added to the
appropriate Schedule herein. In the event that new circumstances exist at
Closing that affect the contribution or license of Software pursuant to this
Agreement, the Parties will meet and mutually agree to the appropriate treatment
of such Software.

Section 7.04 Costs, Expenses and Fees.

Visteon shall be responsible, at its sole cost and expense, for all Consent
Expenses and the Company and Visteon will share equally in all Transfer Fees.
Visteon and the Company shall cooperate to minimize any such Transfer Fees.

Section 7.05 Consents.

Visteon shall use commercially reasonable efforts, and the Company shall
cooperate as necessary, to ensure that any consent, permission or waiver
required to be provided to the Company shall also provide, to the extent
applicable, for the future transfer of such consent, permission or waiver to a
ACH Buyer and Ford.

Section 7.06 Assignment.

Except as set forth in Section 3.04 above with respect to the assignment or
sublicensing of the licenses granted to the Company in Section 3.01, Section
3.02 and Section 3.03 above, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns; provided that, except as provided herein, no Party may assign, delegate
or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement
without the consent of the other Party hereto; provided, however, that Visteon
may assign this


12
<PAGE>
Agreement to any directly or indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of Visteon
without the consent of the Company.

Section 7.07 Other Terms.

All other terms and conditions of the Contribution Agreement, to the extent
they do not conflict with the terms and conditions of this Software Agreement,
are incorporated into this Software Agreement. In the event of a conflict of
terms, the terms of the Contribution Agreement shall control.

Section 7.08 Counterparts.

This Software Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, all of
which, taken together, shall be considered to be one and the same instrument.

installation of all corrections, enhancements, updates and new versions provided
by FocusSoft to CUSTOMER under this Agreement and (b) the absence of damage or
abuse to the Software System(s). Notwithstanding the foregoing, CUSTOMER
acknowledges that since the Software System(s) is complex and, therefore, may

shall, within a reasonable period of time, provide all reasonable programming
services to correct programming errors in the Software System(s) or, at its
option, replace the Software System(s).

(b) FOCUSSOFT MAKES NO OTHER WARRANTY, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT
TO THE SOFTWARE SYSTEM(S), ITS (THEIR) MERCHANTABILITY OR ITS (THEIR) FITNESS
FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE. FOCUSSOFT SHALL NOT BE LIABLE IN ANY EVENT FOR LOSS

SCHEDULE 1

GENERAL TERMS

1.0  DEFINITIONS.  When used in this Agreement, the capitalized terms listed
below shall have the following meanings:

1.1  ""AFFILIATE"" shall mean any majority-owned subsidiary of ACC or
any joint venture entity, whether in corporate or partnership form, in which ACC
owns or controls, directly or indirectly, fifty percent or more of the aggregate
stock or other interest entitled to vote on general decisions reserved to the
stockholders, partners, or other owners of such entity, provided that any such
entity shall be deemed an AFFILIATE for so long, and only so long, as ACC
continues to hold such interest and only so long as any such entity owns and
operates a business or businesses substantially similar to ACC's line(s) of
business as conducted at any time during the term of this Agreement.

1.2  ""CODE"" shall mean computer programming code pertaining solely to
the SOFTWARE.  If not otherwise specified, CODE shall include only OBJECT CODE
and not SOURCE CODE.

(a) ""OBJECT CODE"" shall mean code which is directly machine readable
and executable by a computer after suitable processing and is in a form that is
not generally understandable by humans.

(b) ""SOURCE CODE"" shall mean code other than Object Code and related
system documentation, comments, and procedural programming statements which may
be printed out or displayed in a form readable and understandable by a human
programmer of ordinary or pertinent skill.

1.3  ""DELIVERABLE"" shall mean any tangible material procured or
prepared by Ambix and delivered or licensed to ACC pursuant to this Agreement,
including the SOFTWARE and DOCUMENTATION.

1.4  ""DERIVATIVE WORK"" shall have the meaning set forth in the
Copyright Act (Title 17 U.S.C. (S) 101 et seq.).  AMBIX shall own all DERIVATIVE
WORKS as described in Section 11.

1.5  ""DOCUMENTATION"" shall mean user manuals and other written
materials that relate to the SOFTWARE, CODE, or other DELIVERABLE, including
materials useful for design (for example, logic descriptions, flow charts, class
definitions, principles of operation, and the like).

1.6  ""ENHANCEMENTS"" shall mean changes or additions to CODE and
related DOCUMENTATION made available by Ambix to Ambix
<PAGE>


customers in new releases that improve functions/classes/objects, add new
functions/classes/objects or improve performance by changes to previously
released CODE without changes to system architecture, general design methodology
or method of execution of the object code (e.g. single-threaded or multiple-
threaded).  Further, ENHANCEMENTS as defined under this Agreement shall pertain
to improvements upon, or new releases to, the SOFTWARE and do not refer to any
components, classes or objects licensed to any other Ambix customer which are
not licensed by ACC pursuant to this Agreement.

1.7  ""ERROR"" shall mean any error, problem, or defect resulting from
(1) an incorrect functioning of the SOFTWARE, or (2) an incorrect or incomplete
statement or diagram in the DOCUMENTATION, if such an error, problem, or defect
renders the SOFTWARE inoperable, causes the SOFTWARE materially to (i) fail to
meet the applicable SPECIFICATIONS or the acceptance criteria therefor, (ii) be
inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, or (iii) cause incorrect
functions to occur when any such materials are used.

1.8  ""IP RIGHTS"" shall mean all intellectual property rights,
including inventions, discoveries, improvements, copyrights, patents, trade
secrets, trademarks, and other proprietary rights that are embodied in or used
in connection with the SOFTWARE, the DOCUMENTATION, or other DELIVERABLE.

1.9  ""LICENSE FEE"" shall mean the fee referred to in Section 4.0.

1.10 ""SOFTWARE"" shall mean the computer software, including OBJECT
CODE as defined above, set forth in Schedule II and licensed hereunder,
including any ENHANCEMENTS, modifications to, and other DERIVATIVE WORKS of, the
SOFTWARE as provided under this Agreement.  SOFTWARE shall include any
applicable CODE.

1.11 ""SPECIFICATIONS"" shall mean the detailed design and functional
specifications related to the design and performance of the SOFTWARE and any
other DELIVERABLE hereunder.


2.0  LICENSE OF SOFTWARE.  (a) Ambix grants and ACC accepts a personal,
perpetual, non-exclusive license to use the SOFTWARE pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement.  Such license is granted to ACC for its own use at an ACC-site
location as designated by ACC, and at any AFFILIATE or AFFILIATE-site location
as designated by ACC, and for purposes substantially similar to the business of
ACC.  The license is for a term commencing on the date hereof and extending for
an indefinite period, subject to termination by Ambix pursuant to Section 16.
ACC acknowledges and agrees that the SOFTWARE is not hereby sold to ACC and that
ACC does not by virtue of this Agreement acquire any ownership
<PAGE>


rights in the SOFTWARE or the IP RIGHTS (including copyrights, trademarks, trade
secrets and know-how) embodied in the SOFTWARE, the CODE or in any accompanying
DOCUMENTATION.

(b) ACC shall have the right to grant sublicenses in the SOFTWARE and
other DELIVERABLES to its AFFILIATES pursuant to written sublicense agreements,
provided:

(I) ACC provides Ambix with prior written notice of each sublicense,
and delivers a copy of the sublicense agreement to Ambix promptly after the same
is executed (provided that ACC may delete any information which is confidential
or proprietary to ACC from such sublicense);

(II) Under the terms of the sublicense agreement, the sublicensee is
barred from transferring or further sublicensing the SOFTWARE without the prior
written consent of Ambix (which Ambix may withhold in its sole discretion); the
sublicense contains provisions comparable to Section 10, 11, 14, and 15 hereof
and grants Ambix audit rights comparable to those set forth in Section 6 hereof;
and otherwise such sublicense grants to the sublicensee no rights more extensive
than those granted to ACC hereunder.

(III)  The term of such sublicense is made co-extensive with the term
of this Agreement and subject to earlier termination by Ambix in the event the
sublicensee ceases to be an AFFILIATE of ACC and at that time fails to execute a
separate license agreement and a support and maintenance agreement with Ambix;
and

(IV) ACC either includes the sublicensee in its then current support
and maintenance agreement with Ambix or causes the sublicensee to enter into a
separate support and maintenance agreement for the SOFTWARE.

(c) Ambix will deposit with ACC all SOURCE CODE and all DOCUMENTATION
and other materials useful or necessary to facilitate the use by ACC or its
contractors of the SOURCE CODE as described in Section 19.  If Ambix reasonably
cannot perform its obligations under this Agreement as provided in Section 16,
Ambix grants to ACC the license and right to use the SOURCE CODE of any or all
SOFTWARE pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and ""SOFTWARE"" (as defined
herein) shall include both OBJECT CODE and SOURCE CODE.  Should ACC exercise its
rights to use the SOURCE CODE, all provisions of this Agreement remain in effect
with respect to limitations upon commercial transfer, licensing, sub-licensing
and disclosure of IP RIGHTS.  ACC's use of the SOURCE CODE shall include all
rights and uses reasonably necessary to maintain, support, modify, and enhance
the SOFTWARE and to develop new works or DERIVATIVE WORKS from the SOFTWARE and
other DELIVERABLES.
<PAGE>


(d)  If there is a good faith dispute between Ambix and ACC whether
Ambix has not performed as provided in Section 16, ACC shall be entitled to
exercise its rights under Section 2.0(c) with respect to the SOURCE CODE.  If it
is determined in the resolution of such dispute that Ambix had performed and
will continue to perform all of its obligations in this Agreement, ACC shall
return the SOURCE CODE and related DOCUMENTATION to the repository identified in
Section 19; however, if it is determined that Ambix cannot perform, ACC's right
to use the SOURCE CODE under Section 2.0(c) continues.


3.0  DELIVERY.  Ambix shall deliver the SOFTWARE and other DELIVERABLES on, or
as soon thereafter as is practical, ACC's requested delivery date and to the
locations designated by ACC.  ACC shall be responsible for assisting Ambix in
the installation of the SOFTWARE and shall provide all on-site equipment,
supplies, personnel and computer resource necessary to complete such
installation.  Ambix shall not be responsible for delays or failure of
installation resulting directly or indirectly from causes beyond the reasonable
control of Ambix.


4.0  LICENSE FEE.  ACC shall pay and Ambix shall accept a one time LICENSE FEE
in the amount of $1,600,000 in full payment for this license to use the SOFTWARE
and other DELIVERABLES and all other rights granted hereunder.  In addition, ACC
shall pay or reimburse Ambix for all shipping and handling charges and all
taxes, assessments, fees or charges of any kind imposed by any government,
however designated, relating to this license of the SOFTWARE; including, but not
limited to, sales, use, privilege, excise, withholding, value-added, or property
taxes; excluding, however, taxes based upon the net income of Ambix.


5.0  TERMS OF PAYMENT.  ACC shall pay Ambix immediately upon execution of this
Agreement.


6.0  RIGHT TO AUDIT.  Ambix may, at Ambix's cost, from time to time (but not
more than twice in any calendar year) during ACC's or an AFFILIATE's normal
business hours, have one of its employees or representatives confirm at ACC's
offices, or the offices of any AFFILIATE, that ACC is in compliance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, including performing an on-line audit of
the SOFTWARE and its related databases to assess compliance with IP RIGHTS,
copyright and trade secret provisions of this Agreement.


7.0  DOCUMENTATION.  At the time of the delivery of the applicable SOFTWARE,
Ambix shall provide ACC with DOCUMENTATION
<PAGE>


for each application or other component or module of the SOFTWARE.  ACC may copy
and create DERIVATIVE WORKS from all or any part of the DOCUMENTATION provided
that (a) such items shall be solely for ACC or the applicable AFFILIATE's own
use at ACC's own facilities or the facilities of an AFFILIATE, and (b) such
items shall be created only in connection with changes in the applicable
SOFTWARE or for ease of use and instruction with the SOFTWARE.  ACC or AFFILIATE
shall reproduce on all such copies all copyright, trademark, trade secret,
and/or proprietary rights notices or legends which were on the copies delivered
to ACC or AFFILIATE by Ambix.


8.0  SOFTWARE SUPPORT.  For so long as this License Agreement shall remain in
effect, Ambix shall provide ACC with support and maintenance of the SOFTWARE
under a separate agreement.  Except as otherwise subject to a fixed fee
agreement (as planned for the SOFTWARE), ACC shall pay Ambix's then prevailing
charges for the time spent in servicing such SOFTWARE, including portal to
portal travel time and reasonable transportation, food, and lodging expenses.
Such charges shall not be greater than the amounts charged by Ambix to its most
favored customer for similar or comparable services.


9.0  TRAINING.  If requested by ACC, Ambix shall provide training in the use of
the SOFTWARE for ACC's personnel for up to fifteen (15) days.  Thereafter, Ambix
will provide such training at mutually agreeable times, at mutually agreeable
locations (subject to the availability of Ambix personnel), and at mutually
agreed rates.


10.0  IP RIGHTS AND CONFIDENTIALITY.  ACC acknowledges that Ambix has expended
substantial effort and incurred great expense in designing and developing the
SOFTWARE and DOCUMENTATION.  ACC further acknowledges that the SOFTWARE and
DOCUMENTATION incorporate information, concepts, ideas, know-how, techniques,
and functional characteristics which are confidential and constitute proprietary
information and trade secrets of Ambix.  Ambix acknowledges that it has and will
learn of and about confidential business, financial, operating, and technical
information of ACC and its AFFILIATES, which could include patents, copyrights,
trade secrets and other proprietary rights.  Each party therefore acknowledges
that it will become privy to the confidential information (""CONFIDENTIAL
INFORMATION"") of the other.

10.1 The recipient of such CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION of the discloser
covenants and agrees the following:
<PAGE>


(a) the recipient will hold the CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION in the
strictest confidence and will not assign, license, sublicense, market, transfer,
or otherwise disclose all or any portion of the CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION to any
person or entity without the prior written consent of the discloser, which may
be withheld in the discloser's sole discretion, except in accordance with
Section 18.B or as permitted under this Agreement;

(b) the recipient will take all reasonable steps to prevent
inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure, transfer, or reproduction in any form of
the CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION;

(c)  the recipient will notify its employees and agents of the
confidentiality of the CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION as well as notify its employees
of the prohibitions on disclosure, transfer, and reproduction contained herein;

(d)  the recipient will make its best effort to identify those
employees or agents who may become cognizant of the CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION of
the discloser and request those employees or agents to sign an employee-employer
Confidentiality Agreement;

(e)  the recipient will not remove or alter any copyright, trademark,
trade secret and/or proprietary rights notice and/or legend placed on the
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION by the discloser, and will reproduce all such notices
and/or legends on all copies (including partial copies) of the CONFIDENTIAL
INFORMATION.  The recipient shall immediately notify the discloser of any breach
of the confidentiality of the CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION and shall assist the
discloser in any efforts to control or prosecute any such breach; and

(f)  All right, title, and interest to the IP RIGHTS remain with
Ambix.  ACC obtains only the license and other rights as specified herein with
respect to the SOFTWARE and the other DELIVERABLES subject to all the terms and
conditions hereof.

10.2 Notwithstanding anything in this Section 10 to the contrary, the
confidentiality provisions shall not apply to any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION which
(a) enters the public domain through no fault of the recipient, (b) is
observable based on the operation of any OBJECT CODE, (c) was developed by the
recipient without reliance on such CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, (d) was disclosed
to the recipient by a third party with no known obligation to the discloser to
keep it confidential, or (e) in the good faith belief of the recipient should be
disclosed pursuant to operation of law, regulation, or order or rule of any
court or governmental agency; provided that in the last instance,
<PAGE>


the recipient shall notify the discloser before such disclosure and cooperate in
good faith to limit such disclosure.

10.3 Ambix represents and warrants that it possesses all the rights,
licenses, or other authority to use all IP RIGHTS reasonably necessary or
desirable to conduct its business as presently conducted and to grant ACC the
license and other rights herein.  Ambix has not received any notice with respect
to any alleged infringement or unlawful or improper use of any IP RIGHT or other
intellectual property owned or alleged to be owned by others, and Ambix has no
knowledge of any infringement (or suspected infringement) of any of the IP
RIGHTS.  Ambix has no any knowledge of any claim asserted by any other person or
entity with respect to the use of any IP RIGHT, and Ambix knows of no valid
basis for any such claim.  No director, officer or employee of Ambix has any
interest in any IP RIGHT, all of which are free and clear of any lien, security
interest, claim or encumbrance of any kind.

10.4  Exhibit A sets forth the form and placement of the proprietary
legends and trademark and copyright notices displayed in or on the SOFTWARE.  In
no instance has the eligibility of the SOFTWARE or any component thereof for
protection under applicable patent,copyright, or other law protecting
proprietary rights been forfeited to a third party or the public domain by
omission of any required notice or any other action or inaction.

10.5  Ambix has used its best efforts to keep Ambix's trade secrets
secret, with disclosures being made on a need-to-know basis.  As far as Ambix
knows there has been no violation of this policy, and all Ambix employees and
contractors have been advised of the policy.  The SOURCE CODE, DOCUMENTATION,
and all other trade secrets and confidential information of Ambix related to the
SOFTWARE (1) have at all times been maintained in confidence and (2) have been
disclosed only to Ambix employees and contractors in connection with the
performance of their duties to Ambix.

10.6  All personnel, including employees, agents, consultants, and
contractors, who have contributed to or participated in the conception and
development of the IP RIGHTS (including any component thereof), the
DOCUMENTATION, or the SOFTWARE on behalf of Ambix either (1) have been party to
a ""work-for-hire"" arrangement with Ambix, in accordance with applicable law,
that has accorded Ambix full, effective, exclusive, and original ownership of
all tangible and intangible property thereby arising (including IP RIGHTS), or
(2) have executed appropriate instruments of assignment in favor of Ambix as
assignee that have conveyed to Ambix full, effective, exclusive, and original
ownership of all tangible and intangible property thereby arising (including IP
RIGHTS).
<PAGE>


10.7  Ambix has validly and effectively obtained the right and license
to use, copy, modify, and distribute any third-party programming and materials
contained in or used in connection with the SOFTWARE.  Except as identified in
Exhibit B, the SOFTWARE, the DOCUMENTATION, and the other DELIVERABLES contain
no other programming or materials in which any third party may claim superior,
joint, or common ownership, including any right or license, nor do they contain
derivative works of any programming or materials not owned in their entirety by
Ambix.


11.0  MODIFICATION OF SOFTWARE.  ACC may request from Ambix modifications to or
DERIVATIVE WORKS of the SOFTWARE, including modifications or new versions of the
SOFTWARE to merge with other software programs or systems, thereby incorporating
the SOFTWARE into an overall business or information systems process.  ACC shall
negotiate in good faith with Ambix to prepare such ENHANCEMENTS, modifications,
versions, or other DERIVATIVE WORKS, of the SOFTWARE.  If ACC and Ambix cannot
agree on terms for such services, ACC shall be free to seek others to perform
such work who may use the SOURCE CODE and other DELIVERABLES for such purpose.
As a condition to any such work, any third party contractor shall agree to keep
the SOURCE CODE and other DELIVERABLES confidential and shall agree not to use
or disclose the intellectual property embodied in the SOURCE CODE in competition
with either ACC or Ambix.  Further, any such modifications to, or other
DERIVATIVE WORKS of, the SOFTWARE shall belong to Ambix.  Any modified version
of the SOFTWARE, or any system which incorporates the SOFTWARE in modified form,
just as in its original form as defined under this Agreement, shall be for ACC
or its AFFILIATE's own use as specified under this Agreement.  The modified
version, the newly merged version, or other DERIVATIVE WORK of the SOFTWARE
shall remain subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  In
addition to the notices required by Section 10 of Schedule I (above), ACC or
AFFILIATE shall include the following notice in both machine readable form and
on all DOCUMENTATION for the modified version of the SOFTWARE or merged system
comprising any part or all of the SOFTWARE:

""This program or system includes information, concepts, ideas,
know-how, and techniques which are confidential and constitute
proprietary information and trade secrets of Ambix Acquisition
Corp. of Rochester, New York and are protected by copyright.

(C) 1995 Ambix Acquisition Corp.""

In the event this Agreement is terminated for ACC's default, after any permitted
transition period, the SOFTWARE shall be completely removed from any system
containing the SOFTWARE and
<PAGE>


from any information systems process using the SOFTWARE, whether as a modified
program or modified system integrating Ambix programs in modified or unmodified
form, and treated as if permission to modify had never been granted and all
copies of all DOCUMENTATION shall be returned to Ambix.


12.0  WARRANTY.  Ambix warrants that it is the rightful owner of the SOFTWARE
and DOCUMENTATION and that it has the right to license the same to ACC.  During
the term of this license, Ambix warrants that the SOFTWARE will be free of
ERRORS.  Ambix further warrants that the SOFTWARE will not contain any CODE that
would disable or impair its operation.  Ambix, at its expense, will immediately
correct any ERRORS reported to Ambix.  Ambix's only other obligation under this
Warranty shall be to amend, revise, modify, or replace the SOFTWARE at Ambix's
then-current rates for programming and support services, unless Ambix and ACC
have an agreement for a fixed-price or other reimbursement for such services, in
which case the latter agreement shall control.  ACC agrees that Ambix shall have
no other liability of any kind, whether actual, direct, indirect, consequential
or otherwise.  The warranty contained in this Section 12 shall apply to Ambix
versions of the SOFTWARE, and Ambix makes no warranty as to any version of the
SOFTWARE to the extent modified by anyone other than Ambix.  Subject to Ambix's
warranty obligations or the terms of another agreement with ACC for maintenance,
support, or other development services, amendment, revision, modification, or
replacement of the SOFTWARE will be performed at ACC's request at Ambix's then-
current rates for such services, subject to availability of Ambix personnel.
AMBIX MAKES NO OTHER WARRANTIES.  WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, AS TO
ANY MATTER WHATSOEVER, AND DISCLAIMS ALL SUCH WARRANTIES INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.


13.0  ACCEPTANCE.  ACC will use the SOFTWARE during the sixty (60) business days
immediately following installation (the ""ACCEPTANCE PERIOD"") of the SOFTWARE to
determine whether or not it conforms to the SPECIFICATIONS and is free from any
ERROR.  Any failure of the SOFTWARE to conform to the SPECIFICATIONS or to be
free from ERROR discovered by ACC, during the Acceptance Period, will be
reported promptly to Ambix.  Ambix will immediately make any corrections
necessary to make the SOFTWARE conform with the SPECIFICATIONS and to be free
from ERROR.  The SOFTWARE shall be deemed accepted by ACC upon completion of
such sixty (60) business day period, unless Ambix shall have been provided
written notice by ACC of the failure of the SOFTWARE, setting forth the
particular matters in which the SOFTWARE so fails to conform.  Following receipt
of any such notice, the SOFTWARE shall be deemed accepted upon the correction of
any such
<PAGE>


non-conformity by Ambix and the lapse of a similar sixty-day period without a
report to Ambix by ACC.


14.0  LIMITATIONS OF AMBIX'S LIABILITY.  Ambix's liability under this Agreement
for damages, regardless of the form of action, shall be limited to money damages
which shall not exceed the total amount paid by ACC for the License and other
rights granted hereunder.  This shall be ACC's exclusive remedy.  In no event
shall Ambix be liable for any loss of product, loss of profit, loss of use or
any other actual, special, incidental, consequential damages, or other damages
of any kind whether foreseeable or unforeseeable, resulting from or arising out
of the license or use of the SOFTWARE, even if Ambix shall have been advised of
possibility of such loss or damages.


15.0  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT.  If notified promptly in writing of
any action brought against ACC or any AFFILIATE based on a claim that ACC or any
AFFILIATE's use of the SOFTWARE or other DELIVERABLE infringes the IP RIGHTS of
a third party, Ambix will defend such action at its expense and pay the costs,
expenses (including attorneys' fees, whether incurred as the result of such
action or a claim to enforce this Agreement), and damages awarded in any such
action.  Ambix will have the sole control of the defense of any such action and
all negotiations for its settlement or compromise, except that if any right of
ACC hereunder shall be limited as the result of such settlement or compromise,
ACC shall have the right to approve such settlement or compromise, but such
approval cannot be unreasonably withheld.  At any time during the course of any
litigation arising out of a claim of infringement of an IP RIGHT, or if, in
Ambix's opinion, an IP RIGHT or any part thereof is likely to become the subject
of a claim of infringement, Ambix will, at its sole option and at its expense,
either procure for ACC the right to continue using the DELIVERABLE, replace or
modify the same with a compatible, functionally equivalent, noninfringing
product, or grant ACC a full refund of the LICENSE FEE paid herewith, and accept
its return.  Ambix will not have any liability to ACC under any provision of
this paragraph to the extent the infringement, or claim thereof, is based upon
(a) the use of the SOFTWARE in combination with other software not furnished by
Ambix; or (b) the use of other than the latest supportable version of the
DELIVERABLE made available to ACC.

ACC will hold Ambix harmless from and against any expense, cost,
damage, judgment, or loss or other liability of any kind, for infringement of
any IP RIGHT to the extent it results from Ambix's compliance with ACC's
designs, specifications, instructions or from the use of the DELIVERABLE as
altered or modified by anyone other than Ambix.
<PAGE>


ACC is obligated hereby to promptly notify Ambix of any instance of
infringement or attempted infringement of any IP RIGHTS of Ambix which comes to
ACC's attention.

The foregoing states the entire liability of Ambix with respect to
infringements of an IP RIGHT by a DELIVERABLE or any part thereof or by its
operation.


16.0  TERMINATION FOR FAILURE TO PERFORM.  The rights and obligations of the
parties if the other party defaults or otherwise fails to perform its
obligations hereunder shall be governed by this Section 16.

16.1  The license granted to ACC hereunder may be terminated by Ambix
upon not less than sixty (60) days written notice if ACC fails to perform any of
its material obligations or duties under this Agreement, unless within such
period ACC cures such failure.  If ACC cannot in good faith cure such failure,
other than monetary defaults, within the sixty (60) day period, then ACC shall
be given an additional thirty (30) days in which to cure, provided that ACC must
commence cure immediately and continue to diligently pursue such cure of any
such failure(s).  Upon termination of this Agreement, ACC shall immediately
cease using the SOFTWARE and, at the option of Ambix, ACC shall destroy or
return to Ambix all tangible forms of the SOFTWARE and the DOCUMENTATION and ACC
shall erase the SOFTWARE from all storage media in which it has been installed
or copied; provided, however, if ACC notifies Ambix in writing within 30 days
after the expiration of any permitted cure period hereunder, ACC shall have a
transition period not to exceed one year from the date of such notice in which
to shift from using the SOFTWARE and other DELIVERABLES to new software or other
computer system.  During such transition period, ACC shall pay the support and
maintenance fees, and Ambix shall continue to provide support and maintenance.
Within (30) thirty days after termination of this Agreement, ACC shall certify
to Ambix in writing that it has destroyed or delivered to Ambix all tangible
forms of the SOFTWARE and that it has erased the SOFTWARE from all storage
media.  ACC shall upon request by Ambix permit Ambix such access as shall be
necessary for Ambix to verify to its satisfaction that ACC has complied with the
foregoing requirements.

16.2  If Ambix (a) reasonably cannot perform its obligations under
this Agreement or does not provide support and maintenance for the SOFTWARE, (b)
does not enter into an agreement for the development of ENHANCEMENTS, DERIVATIVE
WORKS, modifications, or new versions of the SOFTWARE or other DELIVERABLE
requested by ACC pursuant to Section 11, or (c) makes an assignment for the
benefit of creditors, or commences or has commenced against it any proceeding in
bankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganization pursuant to bankruptcy laws, laws of
debtor's
<PAGE>


moratorium, or similar laws, Ambix shall deliver the most current version of the
SOURCE CODE to ACC, and ACC shall have the right to use, modify, and create
DERIVATIVE WORKS of, the SOURCE CODE and other DELIVERABLES provided that ACC
continues to observe the obligations contained in Sections 2, 6, 10, 15, and 17.


17.0  EXPORT REGULATIONS.  ACC agrees, regardless of permissions granted by
Ambix, not to export, either directly or indirectly, any SOFTWARE or systems
incorporating the SOFTWARE without first obtaining any required license to
export or re-export from the United States Government or appropriate foreign
government as may be required and to comply with all United States and
international export regulations as applicable.

construed so as to be limited or reduced to be enforceable to the maximum extent
compatible with the law as it shall then appear.  The total invalidity or

in a commercial release) or as ACC may request but not more than twice per
calendar year, Ambix shall deliver to ACC a complete copy of all SOFTWARE in
both OBJECT CODE and SOURCE CODE form and with all applicable DOCUMENTATION and
other tools and materials (e.g., proprietary workbenches, compilers, lists of
third party software, etc.), which a reasonably skilled programmer would find
necessary or useful to maintain, support, enhance, and create DERIVATIVE WORKS
from the SOFTWARE (the
<PAGE>


foregoing are referred to as the ""SOURCE MATERIAL"").  ACC shall deposit the
SOURCE MATERIAL into such vault or safe for safekeeping, and such deposit shall
be witnessed by a representative of Ambix, if requested.  ACC shall have the
right, but not more than twice per year, to engage a consultant to verify the
accuracy of the SOURCE MATERIAL, provided such consultant executes a
confidentiality agreement with ACC regarding the SOURCE MATERIAL.  Except for
such verification and as otherwise contemplated by the terms of this Agreement,
ACC shall keep the SOURCE MATERIAL in the vault or safe at all times.  If ACC
removes the SOURCE MATERIAL to exercise its rights under this Agreement, ACC
shall continue to observe its obligations under Sections 2, 10, 11, and 15 of
this Agreement.

20.0 RIGHT OF DEMONSTRATION ON ACC PREMISES.  Upon reasonable notice and with
the mutual agreement of ACC, Ambix may have access to ACC's operations
facilities for purposes of demonstrating the use of the SOFTWARE to prospective
customers of Ambix.  During such visits, ACC at its sole option may withhold
information it deems proprietary from any visitors.  Ambix will take precautions
not to disturb or encumber the operations during such visits.  ACC agrees to
make an employee available to answer questions should questions arise during a
site visit.

21.0  COMMISSION.  Ambix shall pay ACC a commercially reasonable and customary
commission upon the sale or license by Ambix or any affiliate of any system
which uses a significant portion of the CODE or any DERIVATIVE WORK thereof.

Software and Documentation provided to such Competitor if Licensee on its own

disclosure of the RMSS Software and Documentation to such Competitor within thirty
Days following Licensee’s receipt of RMSS’ written notice.  Any such termination shall be effective upon
the expiration of the cure period.  The foregoing
is intended to apply only to the remedy of termination.  RMSS shall retain the right to pursue any
other remedies in the event Licensee or its Subsidiary makes an unauthorized
disclosure to a Competitor, including injunctive relief or recovery of damages,
and, depending on





4
























the nature of the disclosure, requesting that
Licensee undertake other measures in addition to simply discontinuing

acknowledges and agrees that, in the event of Licensee’s breach or threatened
breach or any provision of Sections 3, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 or 6, RMSS shall have no
adequate remedy in damages and notwithstanding the dispute resolution
provisions in Section 10 hereof, is entitled to seek an injunction to prevent
such breach or threatened breach; provided, however, no specification of a
particular legal or equitable remedy is to be construed as a waiver,
prohibition, or limitation of any legal or equitable remedies in the event of a
breach hereof.





5.             INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.





5.1.          Ownership of RMSS Software and
Documentation.  From the date the RMSS Software and
Documentation is (and was) first disclosed to Licensee, and at all times

and exclusive owners of all right, title, and interest in and to the RMSS
Software, Documentation and all Modifications, including, without limitation,
all intellectual property and other rights related thereto. The parties
acknowledge that this Agreement in no way limits or restricts RMSS and the RMSS
Subsidiaries from developing or marketing on their own or for any third party,
in the United States or any other country, the RMSS Software, Documentation or
Modifications, or any similar software (including, but not limited to, any
modification, enhancement, interface, upgrade, change and all software, Source Code,
blueprints, diagrams, flow charts, specifications, functional descriptions or
training materials relating thereto) without payment of any compensation to
Licensee, or any notice to Licensee.





5.2.          Development Services.  Licensee may from time to time wish to augment the
RMSS product with additional functionality or utility, or to integrate it with
Licensee systems from other sources, and for such purposes may request the
provision of development services, in the form of Assistance from RMSS.





6.             CONFIDENTIALITY.





6.1.          Confidentiality Obligation.  Proprietary Information (i) shall be deemed the
property of the disclosing party (or the party for whom such data was collected
or processed, if any), (ii) shall be used solely for the purposes of
administering and otherwise implementing the terms of this Agreement and any
ancillary agreements,





5
























and (iii) shall be protected by the receiving
party in accordance with the terms of this Section 6.





6.2.          Non-Disclosure Covenant.  Except as set forth in this Section, neither party
shall disclose the Proprietary Information of the other party in whole or in
part, including derivations, to any third party. If the parties agree to a
specific nondisclosure period for a specific document, the disclosing party
shall mark the document with that nondisclosure period. In the absence of a
specific period, the duty of confidentiality for (a) RMSS Software, Source
Code and related Documentation shall extend in perpetuity and (b) with
respect to any other Proprietary Information shall extend for a period of five (5)
years from disclosure. Proprietary Information shall be held in confidence by
the receiving party and its employees, and shall be disclosed to only those of
the receiving party’s employees and professional advisors who have a need for
it in connection with the administration and implementation of this Agreement.
In no event shall Licensee disclose RMSS Proprietary Information to a
Competitor of RMSS. Each party shall use the same degree of care and afford the
same protections to the Proprietary Information of the other party as it uses
and affords to its own Proprietary Information.





6.3.          Exceptions.  Proprietary Information shall not be deemed
proprietary and, subject to the carve-out below, the receiving party shall have
no obligation of nondisclosure with respect to any such information which:





(i)            is or becomes

obligations of confidentiality to the party providing the information;


(iii)          is approved for release by written authorization of the disclosing
party;


(iv)          was known to the receiving party prior to receipt of the information;


(v)           was independently developed by the receiving party without access to or
use of the Proprietary Information of the disclosing party; or


(vi)          is publicly disclosed pursuant to a requirement or request of a
governmental agency, or disclosure is required by operation of law.





Notwithstanding application
of any of the foregoing exceptions, in no event shall RMSS treat as other than Proprietary
Information, information comprising nonpublic personal information under the
GLB Act.





6.4.          Confidentiality of this Agreement;
Protective Arrangements.





(a)           The parties acknowledge that this Agreement contains confidential
information that may be considered proprietary by one or both of the parties,
and agree to limit distribution of this Agreement to those employees of
Licensee and RMSS with a need to know the contents of this Agreement or as
required by law or national stock exchange rule. In no event may this





6




















Agreement be reproduced or copies shown to any third parties (except
counsel, auditors and professional advisors) without the prior written consent
of the other party, except as may be necessary by reason of legal, accounting,
tax or regulatory requirements, in which event Licensee and RMSS agree to
exercise reasonable diligence in limiting such disclosure to the minimum
necessary under the particular circumstances.





(b)           In addition, each party shall give notice to the other party of any
demands to disclose or provide Proprietary Information of the other party under
or pursuant to lawful process prior to disclosing or furnishing such
Proprietary Information, and shall cooperate in seeking reasonable protective
arrangements.





7.             CONTINUING UNDERTAKINGS.





RMSS has no affirmative
duties to Licensee hereunder with respect to the RMSS Software and
Documentation.  Licensee has elected not
to contract for Maintenance Services relating to the Software hereunder and
acknowledges that RMSS has no duty to offer same.





8.             INVOICING AND PAYMENTS, PAST DUE AMOUNTS, CURRENCY.





8.1.          Invoicing and Payment
Requirements.  RMSS shall invoice, at each anniversary
of the Effective Date, for the fees described in Exhibit B hereto as well
as for any expenses and any other applicable charges incurred and owing
hereunder. In accordance with this Section 8.1, Licensee shall pay RMSS the
invoiced amount in full on or prior to the thirty (30) Days after Licensee’s
receipt of such invoice unless Licensee notifies RMSS within such period that
it is in good faith disputing RMSS’ invoice. Licensee shall make all payments
to RMSS by check, credit card or wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account or accounts designated by RMSS. Payment in
full shall not preclude later dispute of charges or adjustment of improper
payments.





8.2.          Past Due Amounts.  Any
amount not received or disputed by Licensee by the date payment is due shall be
subject to interest on the overdue balance at a rate equal to the prime rate as
published in the table money rates in the Wall Street Journal on the date of
payment (or the prior date on which the Wall Street Journal was published if
not published on the date of payment), plus one percent from the due date,
until paid, applied to the outstanding balance from time to time. Any amount
paid but later deemed not to have been due, will be repaid or credited with
interest on the same terms.





8.3.          Currency.  All fees and charges listed and referred to in this
Agreement are stated in and shall be paid in U.S. Dollars.

9.             ASSISTANCE.





9.1.          Basis for Assistance.  If Licensee desires to purchase Assistance from RMSS
or an RMSS Subsidiary, such Assistance shall be provided pursuant to separate
agreement.





10.          DISPUTE RESOLUTION.





10.1.        Dispute Resolution Procedures.  If, prior to the termination of this Agreement or the
license granted herein, and prior to notice of termination given by either
party to the other, a dispute arises between RMSS and Licensee with respect to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, or any subject matter governed by
this Agreement (other than disputes regarding a party’s compliance with the
provisions of Sections 3 and/or 6), such dispute shall be settled as set forth
in this Section 10. If either party exercises its right to initiate the dispute
resolution procedures under this Section 10, then during such procedure any
time periods providing for termination of the Agreement or curing any material
breach pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be suspended
automatically, except with respect to any termination or breach arising out of
Licensee’s failure to make any undisputed timely and complete payments to RMSS
under this Agreement. At such time as the dispute is resolved, if such dispute
involved the payment of monies, interest at a rate equal to the prime rate as
published in the table money rates in the Wall Street Journal on the date the
dispute is resolved (or the prior date on which the Wall Street Journal was
published if not published on the date the dispute was resolved) plus one
percent for the period of dispute shall be paid to the party entitled to
receive the disputed monies to compensate for the lapsed time between the date
such disputed amount originally was to have been paid (or was paid) through the
date monies are paid (or repaid) in settlement of the dispute. Disputes arising
under Sections 3 or 6 may be resolved by judicial recourse or in any other manner
agreed by the parties.





10.2.        Escalation Procedures.





(a)           Each of the
parties shall escalate and negotiate, in good faith, any claim or dispute that
has not been satisfactorily resolved between the parties at the level where the
issue is discovered and has immediate impact (excluding issues of title to work
product, which shall be initially addressed at the general counsel level but
otherwise pursuant to Section 10.2(b) following). To this end, each party shall
escalate any and all unresolved disputes or claims in accordance with this
Section 10.2 at any time to persons responsible for the administration of the
relationship reflected in this Agreement. The location, format, frequency,
duration and conclusion of these elevated discussions shall be left to the
discretion of the representatives involved. If such parties do not resolve the
underlying dispute within ten (10) Days of its escalation to them, then either
party may notify the other in writing that he/she desires to elevate the
dispute or





8




















claim to the President of RMSS and the President of Licensee or their
designated representative(s) for resolution.





(b)           Upon receipt by
a party of a written notice escalating the dispute to the company president
level, the President of RMSS and the President of Licensee or their designated
representative(s) shall promptly communicate with his/her counter party,
negotiate in good faith and use reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute or
claim. The location, format, frequency, duration and conclusion of these
elevated discussions shall be left to the discretion of the representatives
involved. Upon agreement, such representatives may utilize other alternative
dispute resolution procedures to assist in the negotiations. If the parties
have not resolved the dispute within ten (10) Days after receipt of the notice
elevating the dispute to this level, either may once again escalate the dispute
to binding arbitration.





(c)           All discussions
and correspondence among the representatives for purposes of these negotiations
shall be treated as Proprietary Information developed for purposes of
settlement, exempt from discovery and production, which shall not be admissible
in any subsequent proceedings between the parties. Documents identified in or
provided with such communications, which are not prepared for purposes of the
negotiations, are not so exempted and may, if otherwise admissible, be admitted
in evidence in such subsequent proceeding.





10.3.        Arbitration Procedures.  If a claim, controversy or dispute between the parties
with respect to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, or any subject
matter governed by this Agreement (and not otherwise excepted), has not been
timely resolved pursuant to the foregoing escalation process, upon notice
either party may initiate binding arbitration of the issue in accordance with
the following procedures.





(a)           Either party
may request arbitration by giving the other party written notice to such
effect, which notice shall describe, in reasonable detail, the nature of the
dispute, controversy or claim. Such arbitration shall be governed by the then
current version of the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures of
the American Arbitration Association. The Arbitration will be conducted in
Jacksonville, Florida in front of one mutually agreed upon arbitrator.





(b)           Each party
shall bear its own fees, costs and expenses of the arbitration and its own
legal expenses, attorneys’ fees and costs of all experts and witnesses. Unless
the award provides otherwise, the fees and expenses of the arbitration
procedures, including the fees of the arbitrator or arbitrators, will be shared
equally by the involved parties.





9




















(c)           Any award rendered
pursuant to such arbitration shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the
parties, and any judgment thereon may be entered and enforced in any court of
competent jurisdiction.





11.          LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.





11.1.        EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT ARISING FROM GROSS
NEGLIGENCE, WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, BY REASON OF AN INDEMNITY OBLIGATION HEREUNDER
OR BY REASON OF A BREACH OF WARRANTY, EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM OR
CAUSE OF ACTION WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE WHICH ARISES UNDER
OR IS RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE OTHER PARTY’S DIRECT
OUT-OF-POCKET DAMAGES, ACTUALLY INCURRED, WHICH UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL
EXCEED, IN THE AGGREGATE, THE AMOUNT PAID BY LICENSEE TO RMSS UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT FOR THE 12-MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE THE CLAIM
AROSE.





11.2.        IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE
FOR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
KIND WHATSOEVER OR THE CLAIMS OR DEMANDS MADE BY ANY THIRD PARTIES, WHETHER OR
NOT IT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.





11.3.        Licensee Software.  RMSS has no obligation or liability, either express or
implied, with respect to the compatibility of RMSS Software with any other
software unless provided or specified by RMSS including, but not limited to,
Licensee software and/or Licensee-provided third party software.





12.          INDEMNIFICATION.





12.1.        Property Damage.  Subject to Section 11 hereof, each party agrees to
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other and its officers, directors,
employees, and affiliates (including, where applicable, each RMSS Subsidiary and
Licensee affiliates), and agents from any and all liabilities, losses, costs,
damages and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from or in
connection with the damage, loss (including theft) or destruction of any real
property or tangible personal property of the indemnified party resulting from
the actions or inactions of any employee, agent or subcontractor of the
indemnifying party insofar as such damage arises out of or is ancillary to
fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement and to the extent such damage
is due to any negligence, breach of statutory duty, omission or default of the
indemnifying party, its employees, agents or subcontractors.


12.2.        Infringement of RMSS
Software.  RMSS agrees to defend at its own expense, any claim or action brought
by any third party against Licensee and/or against its





10
























officers, directors, and employees and affiliates, for
actual or alleged infringement within the United States of any patent,
copyright or other intellectual property right (including, but not limited to,
misappropriation of trade secrets) based upon the RMSS Software (except to the
extent such infringement claim is caused by a Licensee-specified Modification
to the RMSS Software which could not have been made in a non-infringing manner)
or caused by the combination of RMSS Software with software or hardware not
provided, specified or approved by RMSS, or based upon the Third Party Software
(“Indemnified RMSS Software”). Licensee, at its sole discretion and cost, may
participate in the defense and all negotiations for its settlement or
compromise. RMSS further agrees to indemnify and hold Licensee, its officers,
directors, employees and affiliates harmless from and against any and all
liabilities, losses, costs, damages, and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys’ fees) associated with any such claim or action incurred by Licensee.
RMSS shall conduct and control the defense of any such claim or action and
negotiations for its settlement or compromise, by the payment of money. RMSS
shall give Licensee, and Licensee shall give RMSS, as appropriate, prompt
written notice of any written threat, warning or notice of any such claim or
action against RMSS or Licensee, as appropriate, or any other user or any
supplier of components of the Indemnified RMSS Software, which could have an
adverse impact on Licensee’s use of same, provided RMSS or Licensee, as appropriate,
knows of such claim or action. If in any such suit so defended, all or any part
of the Indemnified RMSS Software (or any component thereof) is held to
constitute an infringement or violation of any other party’s intellectual
property rights and is enjoined, RMSS shall at its sole option take one or more
of the following actions at no additional cost to Licensee: (i) procure
the right to continue the use of the same without material interruption for
Licensee; (ii) replace the same with non-infringing software;
(iii) modify said Indemnified RMSS Software so as to be non-infringing; or
(iv) take back the infringing Indemnified RMSS Software and credit
Licensee with an amount equal to its prepaid but unused license fees hereunder.
The foregoing represents the sole and exclusive remedy of Licensee for
infringement or alleged infringement.





12.3.        Dispute Resolution.  The provisions of Section12 shall apply with respect
to the submission of any claim for indemnification under this Agreement and the
resolution of any disputes relating to such claim.





13.          FORCE MAJEURE, TIME OF PERFORMANCE AND INCREASED COSTS.





13.1.        Force Majeure.





(a)           Neither party
shall be held liable for any delay or failure in performance of its obligations
under this Agreement from any cause which with the observation of reasonable
care, could not have been avoided — which may include, without limitation, acts
of civil or military authority, government regulations, government agencies,
epidemics, war, terrorist acts, riots,





11




















insurrections, fires,
explosions, earthquakes, nuclear accidents, floods, power blackouts affecting
facilities (the “Affected Performance”).





(b)           Upon the
occurrence of a condition described in Section 13.1(a), the party whose
performance is affected shall give written notice to the other party describing
the Affected Performance, and the parties shall promptly confer, in good faith,
to agree upon equitable, reasonable action to minimize the impact on both
parties of such condition, including, without limitation, implementing disaster
recovery procedures. The parties agree that the party whose performance is
affected shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the delay caused
by the force majeure events and recommence the Affected Performance. If the
delay caused by the force majeure event lasts for more than fifteen (15) Days,
the parties shall negotiate an equitable amendment to this Agreement with
respect to the Affected Performance. If the parties are unable to agree upon an
equitable amendment within ten (10) Days after such fifteen (15)-Day period has
expired, then either party shall be entitled to serve thirty (30) Days’ notice
of termination on the other party with respect to only such Affected Performance.
The remaining portion of the Agreement that does not involve the Affected
Performance shall continue in full force and effect. RMSS shall be entitled to
be paid for that portion of the Affected Performance which it completed through
the termination date.





13.2.        Time of Performance and Increased
Costs.  RMSS’s time of performance under this Agreement shall
be adjusted, if and to the extent reasonably necessary, in the event and to the
extent that (i) Licensee fails to timely submit material data or materials
in the prescribed form or in accordance with the requirements of this
Agreement, (ii) Licensee fails to perform on a timely basis, the material
functions or other responsibilities of Licensee described in this Agreement,
(iii) Licensee or any governmental agency authorized to regulate or
supervise Licensee makes any special request, which is affirmed by Licensee
and/or compulsory on RMSS, which affects RMSS’s normal performance schedule, or
(iv) Licensee has modified the RMSS Software in a manner affecting RMSS’s
burden. In addition, if any of the above events occur, and such event results
in an increased cost to RMSS, RMSS shall estimate such increased costs in
writing in advance and, upon Licensee’s approval, Licensee shall be required to
pay any and all such reasonable, increased costs to RMSS upon documented
expenditure, up to 110% of the estimate.





14.          NOTICES.





14.1.        Notices.  Except as otherwise provided under this Agreement or
in the Exhibits, all notices, demands or requests or other communications
required or permitted to be given or delivered under this Agreement shall be in

15.1.        Performance of
Obligations.  Each party represents and warrants to the other that it shall perform
its respective obligations under this Agreement in a professional and
workmanlike manner.





15.2.        Compliance With Law.  RMSS warrants that (i) it
has the power and corporate authority to enter into and perform this Agreement,
(ii) its performance of this Agreement does not and will not violate any
governmental law, regulation, rule or order, contract, charter or by-law; (iii)
it has sufficient right, title and interest (or another Subsidiary of Fidelity
National Financial, Inc. has or will grant it sufficient license rights) in the
RMSS Software to grant the licenses herein granted, (iv) it has received no
written notice of any third party claim or threat of a claim alleging that any
part of the RMSS Software infringes the rights of any third party in any of the
United States, and (v) each item of RMSS Software provided by or for RMSS to
Licensee shall be delivered free of undisclosed trapdoors, Trojan horses, time
bombs, time outs, spyware, viruses or other code which, with





13
























the passage of time, in the absence of action or upon
a trigger, would interfere with the normal use of, or access to, any file,
datum or system.





15.3.        Exclusive Warranties.  EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THIS
AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND EACH
PARTY AGREES THAT ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES THAT ARE NOT EXPRESSLY
PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED AND DISCLAIMED.





16.          MISCELLANEOUS.





16.1.        Assignment.  Except as set forth herein, neither party
may sell, assign, convey, or transfer the licenses granted hereunder or any of
such party’s rights or interests, or delegate any of its obligations hereunder
without the written consent of the other party, provided, however,
that the parties hereby agree and acknowledge that, upon the consummation of
the Merger, Merger Co and Certegy shall each be permitted assignees of Licensee.  Any
assignment hereunder shall be conditioned upon the understanding that this
Agreement shall be binding upon the assigning party’s successors and assigns.
Either party may assign this Agreement to any Subsidiary that is not a
Competitor except that the assigning party shall remain responsible for all
obligations under this Agreement including the payment of fees. Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, Licensee may not assign this
Agreement to a Competitor.





16.2.        Severability.  Provided
Licensee retains quiet enjoyment of the RMSS Software, if any one or more of
the provisions contained herein shall for any reason be held to be
unenforceable in any respect under law, such unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision of this Agreement, but this Agreement shall be construed as
if such unenforceable provision or provisions had never been contained herein,
provided that the removal of such offending term or provision does not
materially alter the burdens or benefits of either of the parties under this
Agreement or any Exhibit or Schedule, in which case the unenforceable portion
shall be replaced by one that reflects the parties original intent as closely
as possible while remaining enforceable.





16.3.        Third Party Beneficiaries.  Except as set forth herein, the provisions of this
Agreement are for the benefit of the parties and not for any other person.
Should any third party institute proceedings, this Agreement shall not provide
any such person with any remedy, claim, liability, reimbursement, cause of
action, or other right.





16.4.        Governing Law; Forum Selection;
Consent of Jurisdiction.  This Agreement will be governed by and
construed under the laws of the State of Florida, USA,





14
























without regard to principles of conflict of laws. The
parties agree that the only circumstance in which disputes between them, not
otherwise excepted from the resolution process described in Section 10, will
not be subject to the provisions of Section 10 is where a party makes a good
faith determination that a breach of the terms of this Agreement by the other
party requires prompt and equitable relief. Each of the parties submits to the
personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in Jacksonville,
Florida with respect to such judicial proceedings. Each of the parties waives
any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or
proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety or to other security that
might be required of any party with respect thereto. Any party may make service
on the other party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the party
to be served at the address set forth in Section 14 above. Nothing in this
Section, however, shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in
any other manner permitted by law or in equity. Each party agrees that a final
judgment in any action or proceeding so brought shall be conclusive and may be
enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law or in
equity.





16.5.        Executed in Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each
of which shall be an original, but such counterparts shall together constitute
but one and the same document.





16.6.        Construction.  The headings and numbering of sections in this
Agreement are for convenience only and shall not be construed to define or
limit any of the terms or affect the scope, meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement or the particular section to which they relate. This Agreement and
the provisions contained herein shall not be construed or interpreted for or
against any party because that party drafted or caused its legal representative
to draft any of its provisions.





16.7.        Entire Agreement.  This Agreement, including the Exhibits and Schedules
attached hereto and the agreements referenced herein constitute the entire
agreement between the parties, and supersedes all prior oral or written
agreements, representations, statements, negotiations, understandings,
proposals, marketing brochures, correspondence and undertakings related
thereto.  Without limiting the foregoing,
the parties expressly acknowledge that this Agreement, together with the
Exhibits and Schedules hereto, is intended to amend and restate the Prior
License Agreement in its entirety, and upon the effectiveness of this
Agreement, the Prior License Agreement shall be deemed to have been superseded
and replaced in its entirety by this Agreement.





16.8.        Amendments and Waivers.  This Agreement may be amended only by written
agreement signed by duly authorized representatives of each party. No waiver of
any provisions of this Agreement and no consent to any default under this
Agreement shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by
or on behalf of both parties. No course of dealing or failure of any party to
strictly enforce any term, right or condition of this Agreement shall be
construed as a





15
























waiver of such term, right or condition. Waiver by
either party of any default by the other party shall not be deemed a waiver of
any other default.





16.9.        Remedies Cumulative.  Unless otherwise provided for under this Agreement,
all rights of termination or cancellation, or other remedies set forth in this
Agreement, are cumulative and are not intended to be exclusive of other
remedies to which the injured party may be entitled by law or equity in case of
any breach or threatened breach by the other party of any provision in this
Agreement. Use of one or more remedies shall not bar use of any other remedy
for the purpose of enforcing any provision of this Agreement.





16.10.      Taxes.  All charges and fees to be paid under this Agreement
are exclusive of any applicable sales, use, service or similar tax which may be
assessed currently or in the future on the RMSS Software or related services
provided under this Agreement. If a sales, use, services or a similar tax is
assessed on the RMSS Software or related services provided to Licensee under
this Agreement, Licensee will pay directly, reimburse or indemnify RMSS for
such taxes as well as any applicable interest and penalties. Licensee shall pay
such taxes in addition to the sums otherwise due under this Agreement. RMSS
shall, to the extent it is aware of taxes, itemize them on a proper VAT, GST or
other invoice submitted pursuant to this Agreement. All property, employment
and income taxes based on the assets, employees and net income, respectively,
of RMSS shall be RMSS’s sole responsibility. The parties will cooperate with
each other in determining the extent to which any tax is due and owing under
the circumstances and shall provide and make available to each other any
withholding certificates, information regarding the location of use of the RMSS
Software or provision of the services or sale and any other exemption
certificates or information reasonably requested by either party.





16.11.      Press Releases. The parties shall consult with each other
in preparing any press release, public announcement, news media response or
other form of release of information concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby that is intended to provide such information
to the news media or the public (a “Press Release”). Neither party shall issue
or cause the publication of any such Press Release without the prior written
consent of the other party; except that nothing herein will prohibit either
party from issuing or causing publication of any such Press Release to the
extent that such action is required by applicable law or the rules of any
national stock exchange applicable to such party or its affiliates, in which
case the party wishing to make such disclosure will, if practicable under the
circumstances, notify the other party of the proposed time of issuance of such
Press Release and consult with and allow the other party reasonable time to
comment on such Press Release in advance of its issuance.





16




















16.12.      Effectiveness.
Notwithstanding the date hereof, this Agreement shall become effective
as of the date and time that the Merger becomes effective pursuant to the terms
of the Certegy Merger Agreement.





IN
WITNESS WHEREOF, the
parties have executed this Agreement as of the Effective Date by their duly
authorized representatives.

OBJECT CODE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT

This  Agreement is entered into by D2  Technologies,  Inc. a corporation  of the
State of  California  with a place of business at 104 West  Anapamu  St.,  Santa
Barbara,  CA 93101  (hereinafter  called  ""D2"") and  Vodavi  Technology,  Inc. a
Deleware corporation with a principal place of business at 8300 E. Raintree Dr.,
Scottsdale, AZ 85260 (hereinafter called ""LICENSEE""). The effective date of this
Agreement shall be the later of the dates executed by the respective parties.

RECITALS.

WHEREAS,  D2 has the right to grant the  rights to use and  distribute  the
Licensed Software specified in Exhibit A; and

WHEREAS,  LICENSEE  desires to obtain such rights to use and distribute the
Licensed Software described hereinafter; and

WHEREAS, D2 desires to provide LICENSEE with such rights upon the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement; and

WHEREAS,  Connected Systems,  Inc. a corporation of the State of California
having a place of business at 126 W. Figueroa St., Santa Barbara,  CA 93101
(herinafter  CONNECTED) and LICENSEE have entered into a License  Agreement
effective  the  date  hereof,  WHEREAS  CONNECTED  and  D2  are  affiliated
entities; WHEREAS LICENSEE requires the use of D2 technology to fulfill its
Agreement with CONNECTED;

NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of  the  foregoing  recitals  and  the
covenants and conditions set forth in this Agreement,  the parties agree as
follows.

1.0 DEFINITIONS

1.1  ""LICENSEE""  shall mean the legal entity  identified as the LICENSEE on
the face page of this Agreement.

1.2 ""Licensed  Software""  shall mean D2's software  products  identified in
Exhibit A  including  all  manuals  and other  related  technical  documentation
provided by D2, and including all updates thereto delivered to LICENSEE by D2.

1.4 ""Binary Code"" means the binary executable form of the Licensed Software
which may be linked with other  LICENSEE-provided  software  and embedded in the
Bundled Product.

groups  described  in Exhibit B, which has been or will be developed by LICENSEE
and which incorporates in the Bundled Product, in any manner, any portion of the
Binary Code. A Bundled Product  represents  sufficient value  enhancement to the
Licensed  Software  such that the  primary  reason for  LICENSEE's  customer  to
license such Bundled Product is other than the right to receive a license to the
Licensed Software included in the Bundled Product.

2.0 GRANT OF RIGHTS

2.1 LICENSE.  Subject to the terms and  conditions  of this  Agreement:  D2
grants a  nontransferable,  fully paid up,  perpetual,  nonexclusive  license to
execute the Binary Code of the  Licensed  Software  only in a  configuration  in
which the Licensed Software is embedded within LICENSEE's Bundled Product.

LICENSEE may transfer  the Binary Code of the  Licensed  Software to  LICENSEE'S
customers,  embedded in LICENSEE's  Bundled  Product,  provided that the Bundled
Product (including the embedded software) is transferred pursuant to an End-User
License which shall contain at a minimum all of the following provisions:

1.   The  Licensed  Software is licensed,  not sold.  Title does not pass to the
LICENSEE  customer.  The LICENSEE  customer will not make any copies of the
Licensed Software except as required for backup and archival purposes.

2.   Each  license   granted  to  LICENSEE   customer   shall  be  a  perpetual,
nonexclusive and nontransferable  license to use the Binary Code version of
the Licensed Software.

3.   A Protection of Confidential Software clause similar to the clause provided

3.0 ADDITIONAL OBLIGATIONS

3.1  Delivery.  D2 will  ship to  LICENSEE  one  (1)  copy of the  Licensed
Software upon execution of this Agreement and the CONNECTED  License  Agreement.
LICENSEE shall have no runtime License fee obligation to D2.

3.2 LIMITED WARRANTY

For a period  of one year  after  delivery  of the  Licensed  Software,  D2
warrants that the Licensed Software will perform substantially  according to the
description and specifications contained in D2's Software documents.  During the
warranty period,  LICENSEE may request and D2 shall provide,  technical support,
as described  in Paragraph  3.2 (a),  (b),  (c) and (d) of this  Agreement,  and
software  updates,  as  requested by  Licensee,  at the Time and  Material  fees
charges offered to other similarly situated customers. For each year thereafter,
LICENSEE  may renew such  technical  support and  software  updates on an annual
basis at the  then-current  D2  maintenance  fee,  if such  support  and updates
services are available.

D2 telephone and written technical support are as follows:

(a)  D2 will  assist  LICENSEE in  determining  if  problems  LICENSEE  may
encounter are caused by programming errors in the Licensed Software.

(b)  D2 will  answer  questions  concerning  installation  of the  Licensed
Software in original delivered configuration, unmodified by Customer.

(c)  D2 will provide  assistance with resolving  LICENSEE's  problems which
occur during the normal usage of the Licensed Software.

(d)  D2 will use reasonable  efforts to remedy any programming error in the
Licensed Software which is attributable to D2 which causes the failure
to meet specifications.

Subject to the  limitations  set out below,  the sole remedy for failure to meet
the limited warranty shall be D2's reasonable  efforts to remedy any programming
error in the Licensed  Software which is attributable to D2 and which causes the
failure to meet the  warranty.  Such remedy may consist of  supplying  corrected
portion(s) of Licensed  Software,  or  communication to LICENSEE of a workaround
which gives LICENSEE the ability to achieve substantially the same functionality
as would be obtained without the programming  error, as may be determined by D2.
If D2 is unable to provide such remedy within a reasonable time, D2 shall accept
return of that portion of Licensed  Software which is in breach of this warranty
and refund to LICENSEE the full value of such portion of the Licensed Software.

Limitations:

D2's efforts  shall be promptly  initiated  only after  LICENSEE has provided D2
with written notice of its claim of any such programming  error. An error report
must contain sufficient information,  on computer-readable media if practicable,
for D2 to reproduce the

3

D2 Technologies and Connected Systems Proprietary and Confidential
<PAGE>
problem.  D2 shall have no obligations for any Licensed  Software which includes
any  modifications  made  by  LICENSEE,  or  for  LICENSEE-specific  application
software and drivers.  D2 shall also have no  obligations  for the correction of
errors or problems which are due to operational  characteristics of the computer
equipment on which the Licensed Software is used.

In order to have the benefit of D2's efforts, LICENSEE must provide D2 with data
and information,  as requested, and with sufficient support and test time on the
LICENSEE's  Development  Computer  system and Bundled  Product to duplicate  the
problem,  determine  if the  problem  is  with  the  Licensed  Software  covered
hereunder,  correct  the  problem  and  determine  that  the  problem  has  been
corrected.

LICENSEE shall reimburse D2 for traveling  expenses if D2 personnel are required
to travel to either the LICENSEE'S  premise or LICENSEE'S  customer's premise in
order to fix the  reported  problem.  LICENSEE  must  designate a named  contact
person and alternate  contact  person per  installation  who will submit problem
reports  and  receive  all  corrections,   upgrades,  correspondence  and  other
communications concerning the Licensed Software.

option,  either:  (a) procure  for  LICENSEE  the right to  continue  using such
Licensed   Software   or  (b)  modify   such   Licensed   Software  to  make  it

costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees)
arising out of or related to any material breach of

7.4      Intellectual Property Infringement Indemnification. Each Party
agrees to hold the other Party, its subsidiaries,

(collectively, the ""Indemnities"") harmless from and against
any claim of any nature, including, but not limited to,
administrative, civil or criminal procedures, which is or may

obligation to indemnify the other for any claims of
infringement based on any modification by the latest version

any Software that is the subject of this Agreement becomes, or
is likely to become, the subject of a claim involving the
infringement or other violation of any patent, copyright,
trade secret, or other intellectual property rights of any
third party, the Parties will jointly determine in good faith
what appropriate steps can be agreed upon, with a view towards
curing such infringement or other violation, at the Software
owner's sole charge. Such steps may include, but are not
limited to:

(i)      The owner securing the right for the other Party to
continue using the Joint Software, or

(ii)     The owner replacing or modifying the Software so that
it becomes non-infringing.

If no other option is reasonably available, the owner of the

8.2      Breach of Material Obligations. In the event a Party fails to
perform any of its material obligations under this Agreement,
the non-breaching Party has given written notice to the other
Party of such failure to perform, and the breach is not cured

9.3      Additional Instruments. Notwithstanding termination of this
Agreement, the Parties covenant and agree to execute and
deliver any additional instruments or documents necessary to
carry out the general intent of this Agreement, including
without limitation patent assignments or any other assignments

to the other Party. Each Party, therefore, subject to a claim
of laches, estoppel, acquiescence or other delay in seeking
relief, consents and agrees that the other Party shall be

immediately discontinue its use, if any, of any Cisco Mark.

6.   Ownership and Proprietary Rights.  LICENSEE represents, warrants,
acknowledges and agrees that CISCO has and will retain all right, title and

CONFIDENTIAL


8.   Effect of Termination.

(a)  Upon termination of the Agreement, LICENSEE will immediately
discontinue use of the Software and destroy or return to CISCO any and
all copies of the Software and any Confidential Information in the
possession of LICENSEE or LICENSEE's Customer(s) and certify to CISCO
in writing within five (5) business days after termination that
LICENSEE has destroyed or has returned to CISCO the Software and the
Confidential Information. This requirement applies to copies in all
forms, partial and complete, in all types of media and computer
memory, and whether or not modified or merged into other materials.
Termination of this Agreement will not limit either party from
pursuing any other remedies available to it, including injunctive
relief, nor will such termination relieve LICENSEE of its obligation
to pay all fees that accrued prior to such termination. Upon
termination of the Agreement, CISCO will have no further obligations
to support the Software or provide services.

(b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon termination or expiration of the
Agreement, no license, express or implied is granted to LICENSEE or
Customer to any CISCO proprietary rights in the Software.

9.   Payment Terms. All Software Maintenance fees and other amounts due under
this Agreement are payable within 30 days of the date of CISCO's invoice.
If not paid within 30 days of invoice date, CISCO reserves the right to
assess interest on the unpaid balance at 1.5% per month.

10.  Installation. LICENSEE will be solely responsible to Customers for
installing the Software and providing all hubs, switches, routers, server,
jacks and related wiring, and all telephone, cabling, telecommunications
and network service communications, including Internet service access
provisions, parts, and supplies, necessary for installing the Software.

11.  Software Maintenance.  Upon acceptance of and pursuant to an Order Form,
CISCO shall provide the maintenance, technical support and other services
as set forth in Exhibit B.

12.  Confidentiality. ""Confidential Information"" means the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, the existence of the discussion between the parties,
information relating to the Software, including without limitation,
processes, techniques, formulas, ideas, know-how, works of authorship,
copyrightable works, inventions (whether patentable or not), technical
information, trade secrets, computer programs, computer code, designs,
technology, compositions, data, drawings, schematics, customers, product
development plans, and other business, technical and financial information,
and other information that is provided to LICENSEE in confidence by CISCO
or to CISCO in confidence by LICENSEE. At all times, both during this
Agreement and after its termination, each party will protect the other
party's Confidential Information from unauthorized dissemination and use
with the same degree of care that each such party uses to protect its own
like information, but with not less than reasonable care and diligence, and
shall not disclose any Confidential Information without the prior written
consent of the other party. Each party agrees to only use the other party's
Confidential Information for the purposes of this Agreement. Neither party
shall be obligated under this Section 12 with respect to information the
receiving party can document : (i) is or has become publicly known through
no fault of the receiving party or its employees or agents; or (ii) is
required to be disclosed by a valid court order issued by a court or
government agency, provided that the receiving party provides to the
disclosing party: (a) prior written notice of such obligation; and (b) the
opportunity to oppose such disclosure or obtain a protective order. Each
party acknowledges that any disclosure or unauthorized use of the other
party's Confidential Information will constitute a material breach of this
Agreement and cause substantial and irreparable harm for which damages
would not be a fully adequate remedy, and, therefore, in the event of any
such breach, in addition to other available remedies, either party shall
have the right to obtain appropriate injunctive relief.

13.  Indemnity.  LICENSEE shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless CISCO and
its officers, directors, employees, customers, agents, successors and
assigns from and against any and all loss, damage, settlement or expense,
as incurred, resulting from or arising of: (a) the combination, operation,
or use of any Software licensed hereunder with, equipment, devices, or
software not supplied by CISCO; (b) Internet Access or any other services
offered or used by LICENSEE through use of the Software; (c) alteration or
modification of any Software supplied hereunder; or (d) any use of or
access to the Software by LICENSEE or LICENSEE's Customers.

14.  Warranty Disclaimer. THE SOFTWARE AND ANY OTHER PRODUCTS OR INFORMATION
PROVIDED TO LICENSEE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT ARE BEING PROVIDED ON AN ""AS IS""
BASIS. CISCO DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT
NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
TITLE AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. CISCO DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE
SOFTWARE WILL MEET LICENSEE'S OR ITS CUSTOMERS' REQUIREMENTS OR
EXPECTATIONS, THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL OPERATE IN THE COMBINATIONS WHICH
LICENSEE MAY SELECT FOR USE, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE
UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT ALL SOFTWARE ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED.
FURTHER, CISCO DOES NOT WARRANT, GUARANTEE, OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS
REGARDING USE, OR THE RESULTS OF USE OF THE SOFTWARE IN TERMS OF
CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, CURRENTNESS, OR OTHERWISE OR REGARDING
THE CUSTOMER'S OR END USER'S SATISFACTION. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE IS ASSUMED BY LICENSEE.

HEREUNDER FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND UNDER ANY THEORY WHATSPOEVER INCLUDING

PROFITS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER CISCO HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE EXPECTATION OR
EXISTENCE.

16.  Basis of Bargain.  EACH PARTY RECOGNIZES AND AGREES THAT THE WARRANTY
DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE MATERIAL

17.2. Assignment.  LICENSEE may not assign its rights or delegate its
obligations hereunder, either in whole or in part, whether by

consent will be void. The rights and liabilities of the parties under
this Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties'
respective successors and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, LICENSEE may assign its rights and obligations under this
Agreement as part of a merger, corporate reorganization, or sale of
assets, provided; i) LICENSEE first notifies CISCO in writing; and

shall make these records reasonably available for audit by CISCO upon
reasonable prior written notice to LICENSEE, during regular business
hours, at LICENSEE's principal place of business. Unless otherwise
specified herein, the cost of the audit shall be at Cisco's expense.
If an audit reveals that the number of copies of the Software
deployed by LICENSEE pursuant to this Agreement is greater than
1,500, LICENSEE shall pay the cost of the audit as well as promptly
remit to CISCO the appropriate license fees due for the number of
copies of the Software deployed by LICENSEE in excess of 1,500.

17.5. No Agency.  The Agreement does not create any agency, partnership,
joint venture, or franchise relationship. Each party hereto is an
independent contractor. Neither party has the right or authority to,
and shall not, assume or create any obligation of any nature
whatsoever on behalf of the other party or bind the other party in
any way.

17.6. Force Majeure.  Except for the obligation to pay monies due and
owing, neither party shall be liable for any delay or failure in
performance due to events outside the defaulting party's reasonable
control, including without limitation acts of God, earthquake, labor
disputes, shortages of supplies, actions of governmental entities,
riots, war, fire, epidemics, or delays of common carriers or other
circumstances beyond its reasonable control. The obligations and
rights of the excused party shall be extended on a day to day basis
for the time period equal to the period of the excusable delay.

Agreement are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining
provisions will nevertheless continue in full force and effect. No
amendments, modifications or waivers will be binding or enforceable
unless they are in writing and executed by authorized persons of each
party. This Agreement, together with all attachments and exhibits,
supersedes any and all prior agreements or understandings, both
written and oral, between LICENSEE or CII and CSS, including without
limitation any support obligations between LICENSEE or CII and CSS,
and constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
to the subject matter of this Agreement.

.    Priority 1 and 2 access to the Technical Assistance Center (TAC) 24 hours a
day, seven days a week
.    Priority 3 and 4 escalation times that correspond with local business hours

Software Application Support Plus Upgrades (SASU) provides:

.    Major software upgrades (major releases) for the covered product
.    Software maintenance updates (minor releases) for the covered product
.    Upgrades and updates automatically shipped when the new release is made
orderable

.    Priority 3 and 4 escalation times that correspond with local business hours
.    Access to CCO where available

CISCO requests that LICENSEE provide the priority of every case reported. To
ensure that all problems are reported in a standard format, CISCO has
established the following problem priority definitions:

.    Priority 1---An existing network is down or there is a critical impact to
the LICENSEE's business operations. CISCO and the LICENSEE will commit
necessary resources around the clock to resolve the situation.

.    Priority 2---Operation of an existing network is severely degraded, or
significant aspects of the LICENSEE's business operation are being
negatively impacted by unacceptable network performance. CISCO and the
LICENSEE will commit full-time resources during normal business hours to
resolve the situation.

.    Priority 3---Operational performance of the network is impaired while most
business operations remain functional. CISCO and the LICENSEE are willing
to commit resources during normal business hours to restore service to
satisfactory levels.

.    Priority 4---LICENSEE requires information or assistance on CISCO product
capabilities, installation, or configuration. There is clearly little or no
impact to the LICENSEE's business operation. CISCO and the LICENSEE are
willing to provide resources during normal business hours to provide
information or assistance as requested.


Software Maintenance Renewal

The annual fee for Software Maintenance as defined will be as follows: a) for
SAS - 20% of the then current CISCO's list price for the Software licenses; and
b) for SASU- 25% of the then current CISCO's list price for the Software
licenses. The Software Maintenance term may be renewed by the LICENSEE on an
annual basis.

Void Software Maintenance

LICENSEE shall notify CISCO prior to installation or integration of any not-
previously approved computer hardware component (i.e., video card, network
adapter, etc.) any not-previously approved software component or version
upgrades. LICENSEE understands that CISCO does not guarantee compatibility of
its Software with any hardware or software not certified for use as part of the
System.

to a party, directly or indirectly, from a source other than the other party or
its representatives, provided that such source is not bound by a confidentiality

Property Rights in violation of the warranty in Section 4.1 above.

6.2 Phoenix Indemnification. Phoenix agrees to, and does hereby, indemnify and
hold harmless Intercept from any and all claims, demands, or actions from or

Products provided to Phoenix by Intercept.

following: The party seeking to enforce the indemnity against the other party
shall give written notice to the other party of any claim, demand, or action for

of the Confidential Information and are making it available only upon the terms
and conditions set forth below and they hereby agree:

(a) Not to use any portion of the Confidential Information for any purpose,
except pursuant to the rights and obligations set forth in this Agreement;
and

(b) Not to disclose any portion of the Confidential Information to any
person except the parties' respective officers, directors, employees, and

<PAGE>   5

7.2 Exceptions. If either of the parties are requested or required (by oral
questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena,
civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any Confidential
Information of the other, the party which is subject to such request will
provide the other party with prompt notice of such request(s) so that such other
party may seek an appropriate protective order and/or waive compliance with the
provisions of this letter agreement. If, in the absence of a protective order or
the receipt of a waiver hereunder a party is nonetheless, in the opinion of its
counsel, compelled to disclose the Confidential Information of the other party
to any tribunal or else stand liable for contempt or suffer other censure or
penalty, that party may disclose such information to such tribunal without
liability hereunder.

7.3 Remedies. As money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach
of this paragraph of this letter agreement the parties hereto shall be entitled
to specific performance as a remedy for any such breach. Such remedy shall not
be deemed to be the exclusive remedy for any such breach of this letter
agreement but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or
equity.

8   MISCELLANEOUS

8.1 Title. It is expressly understood and agreed that, as between Intercept and
Phoenix, all right, title, and interest in and to the Program and Documentation
(including any Enhancements) and any other material furnished to Phoenix under
this Agreement vests solely and exclusively in Intercept, and Phoenix shall
neither derive nor assert any title or interest in or to such materials except
for the rights of use or licenses granted under this Agreement. Phoenix shall
own all changes in the Program and Documentation made by or at the direction of
Phoenix and shall own the Derivative Works to the extent they are different from
the Program as delivered.

8.2 Status. Nothing herein shall be construed to create a partnership, joint
venture, or agency relationship between the parties hereto.

8.3 No Conflict of Interest. Phoenix and Intercept represent and warrant that
they have full power and authority to undertake the obligations set forth in
this Agreement and that they have not entered into any other agreement that
would render them incapable of satisfactorily performing their obligations
hereunder, or that would place them in a position of conflict of interest or be
inconsistent or in conflict with their obligations hereunder.

8.4 Compliance with Law. Phoenix agrees that it shall comply with all applicable
laws and regulations of governmental bodies or agencies in its performance under
this Agreement.

8.5 No Assignment. Phoenix represents that it is acting on its own behalf and is
not acting as an agent for or on behalf of any third party and further agrees
that it may not assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement without
the prior written consent of Intercept, except that Phoenix may assign its
rights to a successor to substantially all of its business or assets or any
owner of 30% or more of its equity or any of its subsidiaries.

<PAGE>   6

8.6 Notices. All notices and other communications required or permitted to be
given under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be considered effective
upon delivery when deposited with United Parcel Service, FedEx, or in the U.S.
Mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the appropriate party at the
address noted above, unless a different address shall have been designated in
writing.

8.7 No Waiver. Neither party shall by mere lapse of time, without giving notice
or taking other action hereunder, be deemed to have waived any breach by the
other party of any of the provisions of this Agreement. Further, the waiver by
either party of a particular breach of this Agreement by the other shall not be
construed or constitute a continuing waiver of such breach or of other breaches
of the same or other provisions of this Agreement.

8.8 Force Majeure. Neither party shall be in default if failure to perform any
obligation hereunder is caused solely by supervening conditions beyond that
party's control, including acts of God, civil commotion, strikes, labor
disputes, and governmental demands or requirements.

8.9 Scope of Agreement; Amendment. The parties hereto acknowledge that each has
read this Agreement, understands it, and agrees to be bound by its terms. The
parties further agree that this Agreement is the complete and exclusive
statement of agreement and supersedes all proposals (oral or written),
understandings, representations, conditions, warranties, covenants, and other
communications between the parties relating hereto. This Agreement may be
amended only by a subsequent writing that specifically refers to this Agreement
and is signed by both parties, and no other act, document, usage, or custom
shall be deemed to amend this Agreement.

SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT


This Software License Agreement (hereinafter the ""Agreement""), is hereby
executed on this 26th day of January, 2005, by and between VSUS Technologies,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (""Licensor"") having its principal executive offices
at 444 Madison Avenue, 24th floor, New York, NY 10022, c/o Great Court Capital,
and ViVaVu Systems, Ltd., an Israeli corporation (""Licensee"") founded by Mr.
Amiram Ofir, an individual residing in Israel (""Amiram"") who, prior to today,
was the founder and Chief Executive Officer of Licensor.

WHEREAS, Licensor is the owner of software and related intellectual
property originally developed by an affiliate of Licensee, and obtained by
Licensor when it acquired certain assets from Licensee and as further developed
through January 25, 2005 (the ""Original IP""); and

WHEREAS, a dispute has arisen between Licensor and Amiram, who was the
original developer of the Original IP, involving, among other things, the rights
to the Original IP;

WHEREAS, in settlement of that dispute between the Licensor and Licensee,
among other consideration, Licensee is now leaving the employ of Licensor, and
the parties are executing, simultaneously herewith, a Software Escrow Agreement
(the ""Escrow Agreement"") placing into escrow the source code for the Original IP
(the ""Source Code"");

WHEREAS, Licensee desires to use the Original IP for purposes of
specialized secure E-mail applications and other applications; and

WHEREAS, Licensor expects in the very near future to acquire 1stAlerts
Inc., a Delaware corporation (""First Alerts"") and wishes to provide incentive
for Licensee to assist it (for compensation) in developing certain applications
of the Original IP that may be useful in that business;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises hereinafter set
forth, the parties, intending to be legally bound, hereby covenant and agree as
follows:

1. Grant. (a) Licensor hereby irrevocably grants to Licensee, in consideration
of the royalty payments described in Section 3 hereof and for other good and
valuable consideration, and Licensee hereby accepts, a worldwide, perpetual
license (a) to use the Original IP internally in its own operations, or those of
any affiliates, which may include providing services to third parties, among
other things; and (b) to incorporate the Original IP, in object code format
only, in larger programs and systems of Licensee (the ""Licensee Programs"") which
Licensee then may commercially market, license and sell copies of in object code
form only for its own profit; all in accordance and subject to the limitations,
terms and conditions set forth below. Such license shall be exclusive from the
date hereof through December 31, 2006, except for the rights of Licensor as set
forth in Section 4 below (as to which it shall be non-exclusive); thereafter,
the entire license granted to Licensee hereunder shall be non-exclusive.



1


(b) Licensee may freely sublicense its rights hereunder, provided that
Licensee remains the owner of the ""master"" license hereunder. Licensee shall not
transfer or assign the ""master"" license hereunder (except to Amiram, or to an
entity majority owned or controlled by Amiram) other than in connection with an
Acquisition (defined below), in which case Licensor shall be entitled to
receive, as and when the Licensee receives the consideration therefor, five
percent (5%) of the Net Proceeds of the Acquisition, in kind (meaning in the
same proportion of cash and other items as constitutes the Net Proceeds). As
used herein, ""Net Proceeds"" shall mean the gross proceeds of the Acquisition,
less any commissions or brokerage fees and professional fees (attorneys,
accountants, appraisers, etc.) payable by Licensee in connection therewith. As
used herein, ""Acquisition"" shall mean the acquisition by a third party or
parties unaffiliated with Licensee of either (i) all or a substantial portion of
the Original IP as currently existing or as modified hereafter, not in the
ordinary course of business, and in connection with the agreement of Amiram to
cease his involvement in the business of Licensee to any extent; (ii) a majority
of Licensee's operating assets; or (iii) a majority of Licensee's voting stock
(or the equivalent thereof). ""Acquisition"" shall also include a transaction in
which Licensee merges with a third party or parties unaffiliated with Licensee
including any other transaction similar thereto. This contingent right to
receive said five percent of any Acquisition shall be non-transferable and shall
not (except as exists as of the date hereof) be assigned, encumbered or
hypothecated, and shall be permanently canceled and shall become null and void
in the event of a Bankruptcy Event (as defined in Section 2 hereof) on the part
of Licensor.

2. Term and Termination; Bankruptcy. (a) The term of this Agreement shall be
perpetual, except that the license set forth in Section 1 hereof shall become
non-exclusive on January 1, 2007, and thereafter may be freely licensed by
Licensor to any third party without restriction or limitation, subject only to
Licensee's then non-exclusive license hereunder.

(b) The parties acknowledge and agree that Licensee should enjoy, in the
event of any bankruptcy of the Licensor, the full benefit of Section 365(n) of
Title 11, United States Code (the ""Bankruptcy Code""). The parties are entering
into this agreement and the Escrow Agreement in reliance upon said statutory
provision. Licensor acknowledges that if Licensor or its trustee in bankruptcy
rejects the Escrow Agreement or this Agreement under the provisions of the
Bankruptcy Code, Licensee may elect to retain its rights under the Escrow
Agreement and this Agreement as provided in Section 365(n) of the Bankruptcy
Code. Neither Licensor nor such trustee in bankruptcy shall interfere with the
rights of Licensee as provided in the Escrow Agreement and this Agreement,
including the right to obtain the Source Code from the Escrow Agent (as defined
in the Escrow Agreement). Correspondingly, in the event of any Bankruptcy Event
on the part of Licensee this license shall terminate (unless this license shall
have been assigned to a permitted assignee under Section 1(b) hereunder, and
that assignee at that time shall not have incurred a then-continuing Bankruptcy
Event).

(c) As used herein, the term ""Bankruptcy Event"" shall mean that a party has
filed for


2


protection under the bankruptcy laws of any jurisdiction, or is involuntarily
subjected to such laws or otherwise has been adjudicated a bankrupt, or makes an
assignment for the benefit of creditors, or voluntarily or involuntarily becomes
the subject of any similar laws, or has a trustee or receiver appointed for its
business or property and either acquiesces in same or fails to remove such
trustee or receiver within ninety (90) days, or has substantially ceased
business operations.

3. Payment. As full and final consideration for the license granted hereunder,
Licensee hereby covenants and agrees to cause its affiliate, Galiad Computers
Ltd., and any of its principals having any rights thereto, to release Licensor
from any and all liability to it or them for sums heretofore owed by Licensor as
compensation for the original transfer to Licensor of the Original IP. These
sums shall be considered royalties for the license granted hereunder, provided
that, after application of such sums, this license shall be considered
royalty-free.

4. Nature of Retained Ownership. Licensor hereby covenants and agrees not to
sublicense (other than to end user customers), transfer, sell or assign, from
the date hereof through December 31, 2006, any software using or deriving in
part from the Original IP. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent or restrict
Licensor from developing any such software internally in order to provide
services as part of the First Alerts business or otherwise, nor to sublicense
any such software to bona fide end user customers (as opposed to developers and
vendors, to which Licensor shall not sublicense such software prior to December
31, 2006). Nor shall anything herein be deemed to give either party hereto any
right to any software or other intellectual property developed subsequently to
the date hereof; rather, any such new software or other intellectual property
shall belong entirely and exclusively to the party who developed it, except to
the extent that it incorporates part of the Original IP (in which case the
rights of such incorporated portion shall be in accordance with the rights to
the Original IP provided for hereunder).

5. Protection of Proprietary Information; Non-Competition.

(a) The parties hereby covenant and agree to use reasonable efforts, in
good faith, to protect the ownership and licensed rights in the Original IP set
forth herein, and not to disclose any portion thereof to third parties to whom
such party is not permitted to transfer or sublicense that portion of the
Original IP permitted hereunder. In doing so, each such party shall use at least
that degree of care which it employs with respect to its own most confidential
and proprietary information, and to inform those employees, agents and
consultants who have access to the Original IP that such information is
confidential information and proprietary trade secrets of the Licensor and
Licensee, as provided herein.

(b) The parties each shall notify the other promptly of (1) any suspected
unauthorized use, sale, license, or other transfer of the Original IP, or (2)
the infringement or misappropriation of the copyrights, trademarks or other
proprietary rights in the Original IP.

(c) Licensee shall not, from the date hereof through December 31, 2006,
license or sell any


3


software product which competes with the primary business of First Alerts on the
date hereof: namely, the provision of business economic news and current
business information to subscribers via email, instant messaging or other method
of electronic distribution. For the sake of clarity, and without limitation, the
current business of Licensee, being the provision of special email systems and
functions to businesses and other enterprises, shall not be considered
competitive with the business of First Alerts.

6. Source Code Escrow. Licensee agrees, on behalf of Licensor, to place the
current source code for the Original IP, along with any incidental documentation
or other ancillary materials which Licensor may have, but need not have,
developed for its implementation, in escrow with a mutually agreeable corporate
escrow agent located in Israel, promptly after the execution hereof. The Escrow
Agreement shall govern the disposition thereof. To the extent that Licensee
modifies the Original IP in providing development services to Licensor, Licensee
shall modify the Source Code in escrow (but need not do so with respect to
improvements or modifications which the Licensee may make on its own, for its
own business, rather than in the process of providing development services to
Licensor).

7. Licensor's Representations and Warranties. Licensor represents and warrants
that it has sufficient ownership rights to the Original IP as against any third
party (other than affiliates of Licensee) in order to perform this Agreement,
and has not assigned, transferred, encumbered or hypothecated same. The parties
are not aware of any claim against, or allegation of infringement pertaining to,
the Original IP. However, the parties acknowledge that this is an uncertain and
rapidly changing area of the law. Therefore, the parties hereby acknowledge and
agree that neither party shall be liable to the other for indemnification,
contribution or otherwise, but rather each shall bear its own risk with respect
to any third party claims with respect to the Original IP and the parties'
respective use thereof in conformance with the terms and conditions hereof.

The parties each further represent and warrant to each other than they are
not subject to any agreement, judgment or decree which would prohibit or be
violated by the execution or delivery of this Agreement or by the performance by
a party of its obligations hereunder.

EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN, LICENSOR MAKES NO
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, TO THE ""ORIGINAL IP"" AND
HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ""ORIGINAL IP"" IS LICENSED TO LICENSEE HEREUNDER ON
AN ""AS IS, WHERE IS"" BASIS. NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, OR THIRD PARTY DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOST
PROFITS OR SAVINGS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, OR SIMILAR CLAIMS)

8. Miscellaneous. (a) This Agreement contains the entire understanding of the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes any and all
written and oral agreements and understandings with respect to the subject
matter hereof. This Agreement shall not be construed as creating an agency,
partnership, franchise, joint venture or other relationship between the parties
other than one of independent contractors. Neither party has the right to bind
the other, to act as agent for or with the other, or to conduct business in the
other's name or for the other's account. Neither party shall contract
obligations in the name of, or on behalf of, the other, nor make any
representation, guaranty or warranty with respect to the other's personnel or
services except as authorized in writing by such other party in advance. This
agreement shall be binding upon the parties and their respective successors and
assigns, but any such assignment shall not relieve a party hereto from
responsibility hereunder.

(b) This Agreement shall be modified or amended only by means of a written
agreement executed by both parties. No waiver of any part of this Agreement
shall be effective unless made in writing and signed by the waiving party. No
waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any
subsequent breach of the same or any other provision of this Agreement.

(c) The parties recognize and acknowledge that they would not have any
adequate remedy at law in the event of a breach of this Agreement, and a party
may suffer irreparable damage and injury and/or damages which would be
practically impossible to ascertain, and accordingly the parties hereby agrees
that, in the event of a breach hereof, the other party, in addition to any other
available rights and remedies, shall be entitled to equitable relief with
respect thereto.

(d) In the event any provision of this Agreement shall be held invalid or
unenforceable, such provision shall be deemed modified in time, geography, scope
or otherwise, but only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. To effect
such modification, the said provision shall be deemed supplemented and/or
rewritten (or deleted if such provision is incapable of such addition and/or
rewriting), whichever shall most fully preserve the intentions of the parties as
originally expressed herein.

(e) This agreement shall be governed by the law of the State of New York
but, in deference to the likely location of evidence and the convenience of
witnesses, any disputes or claims hereunder shall be resolved exclusively by the
courts of the State of Israel, and the parties hereby submit to the jurisdiction
of said forum.

(f) Notices and other communications hereunder shall be deemed given when
received at the addresses set forth after the signatures of the parties below,
or at such other address as a party may notify the other party hereto in
accordance herewith. Electronic notification hereunder shall be valid only if
receipt is acknowledged by the recipient.

(g) Paragraph headings herein are for convenience only and shall not be
considered in the

interpretation of this Agreement.

(h) This agreement was thoroughly negotiated by competent counsel for both
parties to their respective satisfaction. Therefore, the parties agree that, in
the interpretation hereof, no weight or consideration should be given with
respect to which party's attorneys prepared the initial draft hereof.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be
executed by their duly authorized representatives.

6.1  If a third  party  brings  any claim,  proceeding  and/or  suit  against BT
Wireless  alleging that the access to or use of the AirBoss Software or SDK
or  Documentation  infringes any third party  Intellectual  Property  Right
(""Infringement  Claims""),  then Geoworks shall be  responsible,  at its own
expense, for defending, or at its option,  settling, the Infringement Claim
and shall indemnify BT Wireless or relevant BT Wireless  subsidiary against
any costs, damages, liabilities, losses or expenses incurred by BT Wireless
or relevant BT Wireless  subsidiary  arising from the Infringement  Claims.
Geoworks shall  immediately on becoming aware of such  Infringement  Claim,
notify BT Wireless or relevant BT Wireless subsidiary promptly in writing.

or  relevant BT  Wireless  subsidiary  (i)  promptly  advising  Geoworks in
writing of any such  Infringement  Claim,  (ii) making no  admission  as to
liability  or  agreement  to any  settlement  or  compromise  of  any  such
Infringement  Claim without  Geoworks' prior written consent,  (iii) giving
Geoworks,  at its  request,  sole  conduct or any  defence  or any  related
settlement  negotiations,  and (iv)  co-operating  fully with  Geoworks and
providing Geoworks with all reasonably  required  assistance in the defence
or settlement of such Infringement Claim.

lieu of  indemnification,  may (a) procure for the other Party the right to
use the Geoworks  Software  without patent or copyright  infringement;  (b)
modify the Geoworks  Software to make it  non-infringing  provided  that is

Wireless and/or its relevant subsidiary;  (c) replace the Geoworks Software
with  substantially  equivalent

<PAGE>

8

software that is  non-infringing  and which delivers the same or equivalent
functionality as described in the  Documentation  and has no other material
adverse  effects for BT Wireless and its  subsidiaries.  If Geoworks and BT
Wireless reasonably determine that (a), (b) or (c) above cannot be achieved
on  commercially  practicable  terms,  then Geoworks may direct BT Wireless
and/or the  relevant  BT  Wireless  subsidiary  to cease use of the AirBoss
Software.

with  respect  to claims  that could  have been  avoided  (i) by using more
current  releases of the AirBoss  Software that have been made available to
BT  Wireless;  (ii) had BT  Wireless or the user not  modified  the AirBoss
Software  without  Geoworks'  written  approval;  and (iii) if the  AirBoss
Software were being used in isolation rather than in combination with other
technology save as contemplated by this Agreement. The foregoing provisions
of this Clause  state the entire  liability of Geoworks and the sole remedy
of other Party with respect to any  Infringement  Claim in connection  with
the Geoworks Software or the use or dealing therewith.

whether in contract,  tort (including negligence) or howsoever otherwise in
respect of any indirect or consequential loss, loss of revenue,  profits or
business,  loss of use or data  whether such loss was foreseen or not or if
the Party has been advised of the possibility of incurring the same.

terminate this Agreement.

9.2  Either Party may terminate  this  Agreement  forthwith on written notice if

Applications,  provided  that in  doing  so,  no use is  made of the  other
Party's  Information,  Intellectual  Property Rights and Background  and/or

written and shall remain in effect in perpetuity (the ""TERM""), unless

Sections 4(a) and (b) are deleted.

Section 5 is deleted and replaced with:

(a)  In consideration for the license and the Transition (as defined
in Section 13 hereof) provided hereby,

(i)      Upon delivery of the source code for the customized

by Section 13(c)(1)(C), E*TRADE will pay Watley
$1,000,000.

(ii)     Upon successful completion of the Transition as
determined in the reasonable judgment of E*TRADE,
E*TRADE agrees to: (i) issue to Watley $2,400,000 of
shares of the common stock, par value $.01 per share,
of E*TRADE (the ""SHARES""), with the number of such
Shares to be issued determined by dividing $2,400,000
by the average closing price for the shares on the
New York Stock Exchange for the ten trading days
prior to the completion of the Transition and (ii)
pay Watley $1,000,000.

(iii)    Any dispute with respect to successful completion of

(iv)    Payments made to date (including the payment for

Watley hereby represents and warrants that it is an
accredited investor within the meaning of Regulation
D prescribed by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the ""SEC"") pursuant to the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the ""SECURITIES ACT""), and that
it is acquiring the Shares for investment for its own
account and not with a view to, or for resale in
connection with, any distribution thereof. Watley
understands that the transaction in which Watley is
receiving the Shares has not been registered under
the Securities Act, that the Shares must be held
indefinitely unless subsequently registered under the
Securities Act or an exemption from such registration
is available, and that the certificates representing
the Shares shall bear an appropriate legend to such
effect.

(c)  Registration Rights with respect to the Shares.

(i)   From and after the date that the Shares are issued to
Watley (the ""ISSUE DATE""), E*TRADE agrees to use
reasonable efforts to file a registration statement
(the

EXECUTION DRAFT

""REGISTRATION STATEMENT"") with the SEC to effect the
registration under the Securities Act of the resale
by Watley of the Shares (together with any shares of
E*TRADE common stock issued in connection with any
stock dividend, split, combination or
recapitalization on, of or with respect to such
Shares, collectively, the ""REGISTRABLE SHARES""), and
to respond promptly to any and all comments made by
the staff of the SEC to such Registration Statement
so as to cause the Registration Statement to be
declared effective by the SEC, subject to the
provisions of subsection (c)(ix) below. E*TRADE will
use reasonable efforts to file the Registration
Statement not later than thirty (30) days after the
Issue Date.

(ii)   E*TRADE agrees that the Registration Statement shall
comply in all material respects with the requirements
of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations
of the SEC promulgated thereunder and shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein, or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading. The financial statements of E*TRADE
included in the Registration Statement or
incorporated by reference therein will comply as to
form in all material respects with the applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC applicable with respect
thereto, and will be prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied during the periods involved
(except as may be otherwise indicated in the
financial statements or the notes thereto or, in the
case of unaudited interim statements, as permitted by
the SEC) and fairly present the financial position of
E*TRADE at the dates thereof and the results of
operations and cash flows for the periods then ended
(subject, in the case of unaudited interim
statements, to immaterial year-end adjustments).

(iii)  E*TRADE shall prepare and file with the SEC, as
promptly as is commercially reasonably practicable,
such amendments (including post-effective amendments)
and supplements to the Registration Statement and the
prospectus used in connection with the Registration
Statement as may be necessary to keep the
Registration Statement effective during the
Registration Period, and, during such period, to
comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with
respect to the disposition of all Registrable Shares
covered by the Registration Statement.

(iv)   E*TRADE shall furnish to Watley promptly after the
same is prepared and filed with the SEC, one copy of
the Registration Statement and any amendment thereto
and each preliminary prospectus and each amendment or
supplement thereto; (B) on the date of effectiveness
of the Registration Statement or any amendment
thereto, a notice to Watley stating that the
Registration Statement or amendment has been declared
effective; and (C) such number of copies of a
prospectus, including a preliminary prospectus, and
all amendments and supplements thereto and such other
documents as Watley may reasonably request in order
to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable
Shares owned by Watley.

(v)   E*TRADE shall use reasonable efforts to cause all
Registrable Shares to be listed on each national
securities exchange or quotation service on which
securities of the same class or series issued by
E*TRADE are then listed.

(vi)  As promptly as practicable after becoming aware of
such event, E*TRADE shall notify Watley of the
happening of any event, of which E*TRADE has
knowledge, as a result of which the prospectus
included in the Registration Statement, as then in
effect, includes an untrue statement of a material
fact or omission to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading, and use reasonable efforts to
promptly prepare a supplement or amendment to the
Registration Statement to correct such untrue
statement or omission, and deliver such number of
copies of such supplement or amendment to Watley as
it may reasonably request.

EXECUTION DRAFT

(vii)  E*TRADE shall use reasonable efforts to prevent the
issuance of any stop order or other suspension of
effectiveness of the Registration Statement, and, if
such an order is issued, to obtain the withdrawal of
such order as soon as practicable (including in each
case by amending or supplementing the Registration
Statement) and to notify Watley of the issuance of
such order and the resolution thereof, and if the
Registration Statement is supplemented or amended,
deliver such number of copies of such supplement or
amendment to Watley as it may reasonably request.

(viii) E*TRADE will keep the Registration Statement
effective until the earlier of (A) such date as all
of the Registrable Shares have been resold or (B) two
years from the date such Registration Statement is
declared effective by the SEC (the ""REGISTRATION
PERIOD"").

(ix)   Without limiting the generality of subsections (vi)
and (vii) above, E*TRADE may defer filing of the
Registration Statement or refuse to permit Watley to
resell any Registrable Shares pursuant to the
Registration Statement at any time if E*TRADE
determines in good faith that such a sale would be in
violation of the requirements of the Securities Act
and the regulations promulgated by the SEC thereunder
or there exists at the time material non-public
information relating to E*TRADE which, in the
business judgment of E*TRADE, should not be
disclosed. E*TRADE shall not under any circumstances
be entitled to exercise its right to defer filing of
the Registration Statement or suspend sales under
this subsection more than two times in any twelve
(12)-month period, and the period during which the
Registration Statement under this subsection may be
withdrawn shall not exceed 90 days each such time.

(x)    Watley agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from
E*TRADE of the happening of any event of the kind
described in (vi), (vii) or (ix) above, Watley will
immediately discontinue disposition of the
Registrable Shares pursuant to the Registration
Statement until Watley's receipt of the copies of the
supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by
(vi), (vii) or (ix) above, if so directed by E*TRADE,
Watley shall deliver to E*TRADE or destroy (and
deliver to E*TRADE a certificate of destruction) all
copies in Watley's possession, of the prospectus
covering such Registrable Shares current at the time
of receipt of such notice.

(xi)   Watley agrees that E*TRADE shall not be required to
conduct an underwritten offering and that any sales
of Registerable Shares shall be made through E*TRADE
Securities Inc., provided that no commission shall be
payable by Watley in connection with such sales.

(xii)  Watley, by its acceptance of the Registrable Shares,
agrees to cooperate with E*TRADE as reasonably
requested by E*TRADE in connection with the
preparation and filing of the Registration Statement,
unless Watley has notified E*TRADE in writing of its
election to waive the obligations of E*TRADE with
respect to the Registration Statement, including
without limitation that (A) Watley will provide
E*TRADE all information and statements about or
pertaining to Watley, and shall execute such
documents in connection with such registration as
E*TRADE may reasonably request, on such timely basis
as is reasonably deemed by E*TRADE to be necessary or
appropriate for the Registration Statement or to
comply with applicable requirements of the National
Association of Securities Dealers or other applicable
regulatory requirements, and (B) Watley will furnish
promptly to E*TRADE in writing all information
required from time to time to be disclosed in order
to make the information previously furnished to
E*TRADE by Watley not misleading. E*TRADE shall have
no obligation to register the resale of the
Registerable Shares or to cause or maintain the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement unless
Watley complies with the terms hereof.

(xiii) E*TRADE pay all Registration Expenses (as defined
below) in connection with any registration,
qualification or compliance hereunder, and Watley
shall pay all Selling

EXECUTION DRAFT

* A ""Response"" is an acknowledgement of a trouble
ticket delivered by E*TRADE to Watley (a ""Trouble Ticket"") or a
response initiated by Watley to E*TRADE in those cases where Watley
discovers the problem without contact from E*TRADE. Watley will
proactively escalate problems that are unresolved in accordance with
the intervals of time listed in the escalation chart. To determine
compliance with the Response intervals, a Response shall be deemed to
be provided to E*TRADE when: (1) in response to a Trouble Ticket,
E*TRADE has received a communication (phone or email or page) from
Watley acknowledging the problem; or (2) Watley notifies E*TRADE
through phone or email or page contact of such problem, if such problem
was discovered by Watley or one of its other partners.
* ""Resolution"" is reached when one or more of the
following actions have occurred: (1) corrective actions by Watley has
resumed service; (2) further use of the application during the
resolution period does not reproduce the problem (in this case, the
problem is considered closed, but can be reopened should the same
problem occur at a later date); (3) the suspected problem is determined
by Watley, in its reasonable discretion and evidenced through records,
to be known code restriction, caused by the applications or the
facilities, equipment, and personnel of E*TRADE other than Watley, its
agents, subcontractors or any third party service provider of Watley
(in which case, it will no longer be classified as a problem); or (4)
Watley and E*TRADE mutually agree that the problem is either resolved
or not considered severe.
* A ""problem"" is a failure of the
Infrastructure Services as described below.
* A ""Severity 1 Problem"" is a problem that
causes a complete outage of the market data services provided by
Watley.  For example, E*TRADE is unable to retrieve market data at
E*Trade's site.  This would be an indication of an outage.  This
example must occur multiple times and be reproducible by Watley
employees
* A ""Severity 2 Problem"" is a problem that causes a
significant failure or degradation in performance of market data
services provided by Watley. Examples: (1) delivery of market data
which is delayed more than one second (1 sec) or (2) Watley code
modules fail to return the correct result. These examples must have
occurred multiple times and be reproducible by Watley employees.
* A ""Severity 3 Problem"" is a problem that that
causes a minor portion of an application to run in degraded mode or not
work as expected but has only minimal impact upon the use of the
application. This problem must have occurred multiple times and be
reproducible by Watley employees.

2.  Response and Resolution Times.

Severity 1 Problem:
Response:        within fifteen (15) minutes
Resolution:      within four (4) hours

Severity 2 Problem:
Response:        within thirty (30) minutes
Resolution:      within twenty-four (24) hours

Severity 3 Problem:
Response:        within one (1) business day
Resolution:      within five (5) business days

Although Watley is under no obligation to resolve non-reproducible
errors, Watley will respond to any such error in the time-frame set
forth above and will use commercially reasonable efforts in
collaborating with E*TRADE to resolve such non-reproducible error.

3.  Escalation Procedures:  If Watley does not respond to requests for
service from E*TRADE within the time frames described above, E*TRADE
may contact Watley escalation contacts below.

Escalation Level         Severity 1       Severity 2        Severity 3

its designated agent to conduct audits to confirm the charges hereunder, to identify any third parties licensed
to use or otherwise provided the Closed Modifications or the Exclusive Modifications and to verify
Licensee’s receipt of appropriate credits in accordance with Section 7.2 above. Any such audit
will be conducted upon reasonable notice and during regular business hours, in a manner designed
to minimize any disruption to Licensor’s business operations. Such audit shall be at Licensee’s
expense, unless such audit reveals a discrepancy of more than five percent (5%) in the total applicable
amount reported by Licensor, in which event Licensor shall pay for, or reimburse Licensee the cost
of, such audit. Overpayments and underpayments revealed in the course of any such audit, if any,
shall be reconciled and settled within thirty (30) days after the auditors’ report is delivered
to both parties.

8             Term.

8.1
“Term” This Agreement shall be effective from the Effective Date through the effective date of termination
under Section 8.2(a) or the expiration of a fifteen-month transition period following Licensee’s receipt
of notice of termination under Section 8.2(b).

8.2            “Termination for Material Breach; Remedies”

(a)          By Licensor. If Licensor should breach a material provision of this Agreement and such breach is not cured
within sixty (60) days after Licensor’s receipt of notice from Licensee, Licensee shall
be entitled to recover from Licensor the total amount of damages and costs Licensee incurs as
a result of Licensor’s breach and have the option to terminate this Agreement. For the purposes
of this subsection 8.2(a), a material breach shall be deemed incurable where such breach involves
any breach of Licensor’s confidentiality obligations as set forth in Section 11 of this Agreement.
Following the termination of this Agreement as set forth in this subsection 8.2(a), the licenses
for which Licensor has been fully paid by Licensee shall continue in full force and Licensee shall
have the option of acquiring any future licenses to the Licensed Technology under the terms and conditions
of this Agreement.

(b)          By Licensee. If Licensee should breach any material provision of this Agreement and such breach is not cured within
sixty (60) days after receipt of notice from Licensor, Licensor shall be entitled to recover
from Licensee any damages and costs Licensor incurs as a result of Licensee’s breach pursuant
to subsection 8.2 (c). In addition, Licensor shall have the right to terminate this Agreement in
the event that Licensee decompiles, disassembles, reverse engineers or otherwise derives source code
from the Licensed Technology without the express written consent of Licensor and such action causes
a material adverse effect upon Licensor (a “Termination Event”). If Licensor, in its reasonable
judgment, believes a Termination Event has occurred, Licensor shall promptly notify Licensee in writing
of the Termination Event and the following resolution process shall be initiated immediately: (1)
Licensee and Licensor shall cooperate to investigate and identify the source, scope and cause of
the Termination Event; (2) Licensee shall ensure that the unauthorized activity that constitutes
the Termination Event is halted immediately; (3) Licensee shall use its best efforts to retrieve
any improperly disclosed information from recipients who acquired or gained access to such information
as a result of the Terminations Event, including commencement of legal action at Licensee’s
expense, if necessary or appropriate; (4) Licensee shall advise any third party recipient that the
improperly disclosed information was proprietary to Licensor and was disclosed without authority
and any use of such information could result in legal action against the recipient; (5) Licensee
shall take immediate steps to ensure that any deficiencies in security or processes that resulted
in the Termination Event are eliminated; and (6) Licensor shall proceed to recover damages from Licensee
pursuant to Section 8.2(c). In the event Licensee disputes Licensor’s determination that a Termination
Event has occurred, the parties shall also refer the final decision with regard to whether a Termination
Event has occurred to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set forth in subsection 8.2(c).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties expressly acknowledge and agree that the above-referenced
process and any such arbitration under Section 8.2(c) shall in no way prevent Licensor from immediately
seeking or obtaining any appropriate injunctive relief as set forth in Section 11.3 to prevent further
activity that Licensor believes constitutes a Termination Event, but no injunctive relief shall be
available to restrain or enjoin Licensee’s continued use of the Licensed Technology that is
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If the arbitrator determines that a Termination Event
has occurred, Licensor may deliver notice of termination of this Agreement to Licensee. As of the
end of the termination transition period, all licenses granted herein shall simultaneously and automatically terminate upon notice to Licensee.




(c)           Determination of Damages. In the event of a material breach of this Agreement by either party that remains uncured for sixty
(60) days after receipt of notice of such breach, Licensor and Licensee shall negotiate in good faith
for a period of ninety (90) days to establish the amount of damages and costs incurred by the non-breaching
party and payable by the breaching party. If the parties cannot agree on damages and costs recoverable
by the non-breaching party by the end of such ninety (90) day period, the party first alleging a
material breach may pursue recovery of damages and costs through binding arbitration in accordance
with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association and the United States
Arbitration Act. The arbitration will be conducted by one (1) arbitrator, selected jointly by the
parties, with at least five (5) years experience in arbitrating technology-related legal disputes,
or selected by the American Arbitration Association if the parties fail to agree on an arbitrator
within a reasonable period. A party may enter judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrators in
a court having jurisdiction.





8.3           “Bankruptcy” The parties agree and acknowledge that Licensee is a licensee of the Licensed Technology and such
Licensed Technology constitutes intellectual property as defined by Section 101(35)(A) of the United
States Bankruptcy Code, and that Licensee shall be entitled to all the benefits granted to licensees
under the






6









provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code including, without limitation, Section 365(n) of Title 11 of the U.S. Code (11 U.S.C. § 365(n)).

8.4           “Rights Upon Termination” Upon written request at the expiration or termination of this Agreement, all documented Confidential Information (and all copies thereof), except for the Licensed Technology, owned by the requesting party will be returned or destroyed by the recipient party, with written certification thereof.

8.5           “Survival” Any accrued payment obligations pursuant to Section 7, the provisions of Sections 1, 2 (with respect to fully paid licenses), 3, 5, 8.4, 8.5, 9, 10, 11 and 12, and any right of action for breach of this Agreement prior to termination shall survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement, except as otherwise set forth herein.

9.1           “Corporate Requisites” Each party hereby represents and warrants that: (a) it has the full corporate power and authority to enter into and perform this Agreement, and it knows of no contract, agreement, promise, undertaking or other fact or circumstance which would prevent the full execution and performance of this Agreement by it; and (b) it is a corporation duly organized and in good standing in the country or state of its incorporation and in good faith is and fully intends to remain in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in the conduct of its business.

Licensor shall undertake reasonable commercial efforts to repair or replace the components of the Software to which Licensor can verify non-conformance within thirty (30) days after such notice in order to c

orrect such non-conformance without materially adversely affecting the performance or functionality of the Software, or, in the event Licensor is unable to repair or replace the Software in order to correct such non-conformance without materially adversely affecting the performance or functionality of the Software within such thirty (30) day period, Licensor shall refund to Licensee the License Fees paid hereunder, less those amounts necessary to cover Licensor’s reasonable development costs, and all fees paid under the Maintenance Agreement relating to such non-conformance. The methods and techniques utilized by Licensor to correct errors shall be at the discretion of Licensor.

9.3           “Other Warranties” Licensor represents and warrants that: (a) if applicable, it shall pass through to Licensee any product and third party end-user warranties and indemnities. To the extent Licensor is not permitted to so pass-through, Licensor agrees to enforce such warranties and indemnities on behalf of Licensee; (b) it has and shall maintain full authority to license the Licensed Technology to Licensee hereunder; (c) to the best of its knowledge, the Licensed Technology and any services provided to Licensee do not and will not infringe upon and are free from any claim by any third party of infringement of any U.S. patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret or any other proprie

tary right of any third party; (d) it will use (and cause its subcontractors to use) commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the Licensed Technology, as applicable, free of software viruses, disabling code or similar items; and (e) the Licensed Technology and any services provided to Licensee are and will be provided in compliance with the requirements of all applicable federal, state and local laws, ordinances, regulations and codes.

9.4          “Disclaimer” EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT AND TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EACH PARTY HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, REGARDING THE LICENSED TECHNOLOGY OR SERVICES PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE OR PURPOSE, SYSTEM INTEGRATION AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND THOSE ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. FURTHER, LICENSOR DOES NOT WARRANT, GUARANTEE OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS THAT THE LICENSED TECHNOLOGY WILL BE FREE FROM BUGS OR THAT ITS USE WILL BE





7










UNINTERRUPTED, OR REGARDING THE USE, OR THE RESULTS OF THE USE, OF THE LICENSED TECHNOLOGY IN TERMS
OF ACCURACY, RELIABILITY OR OTHERWISE.

10           Indemnification.

10.1         “Licensor Indemnity” Licensor shall defend, indemnify and hold Licensee, its directors, officers, employees, agents and
Affiliates harmless from liability resulting from and against any claims, demands, suits and costs,
including reasonable attorney’s fees arising out of (a) any third party claim that
the Licensed Technology or any service provided hereunder infringes any issued United States patent
(and, should Licensor perform any appropriate due diligence to its satisfaction in Canada, Australia
or the United Kingdom, then upon written notice to Licensee, any issued Canadian, Australian or United
Kingdom patent), or any copyright enforceable in the United States, Canada, Australia or the United
Kingdom, or that the Licensed Technology misappropriates any trade secret; and/or (b) a breach of
Section 11, in each case solely provided that Licensor (i) is promptly notified of any and all threats,
claims and proceedings related thereto, provided, however, that the failure to so notify will only
relieve Licensor of its obligations under this Section 10 to the extent that Licensor is prejudiced
thereby, (ii) is given reasonable assistance with the full cooperation of Licensee, and (iii) controls
the defense and all negotiations and decisions regarding a settlement or compromise. Licensor will
not be responsible for any settlement it does not approve in writing. THE FOREGOING IS IN LIEU OF
ANY WARRANTIES OF NONINFRINGEMENT, WHICH ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED.

10.2         “Exceptions and Limitations” Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10.1, Licensor will not be obligated to defend Licensee
or be liable for costs and damages to the extent that any claim of infringement is based on: (a)
modification of the Licensed Technology that is not performed or authorized by Licensor but is by
Licensee, or by a third party at the request or direction of Licensee or a party authorized by Licensee;
(b) the combination or use of the Licensed Technology, or any portion thereof, by Licensee with other
products, processes or materials not supplied by Licensor except to the extent that it relates to
third party software or hardware acknowledged by Licensor as necessary to operate in accordance with
the Documentation or otherwise approved by Licensor; or (c) Licensee’s use of the Licensed Technology
not strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Documentation. Licensee agrees
to defend, indemnify and hold Licensor, its directors, officers, employees, agents harmless from
liability resulting from and against any claims, demands, suits and costs, including reasonable attorney’s
fees arising out of any actions referred to in subsections (a) through (c) of this Section 10.2, in each case solely provided that Licensee (i) is promptly notified of any and all threats, claims
and proceedings related thereto, provided, however, that the failure to so notify will only relieve
Licensee of its obligations under this Section 10 to the extent that Licensor is prejudiced thereby,
(ii) is given reasonable assistance with the full cooperation of Licensor, and (iii) controls the
defense and all negotiations and decisions regarding a settlement or compromise. In the event that
the Software is held or believed by Licensor to infringe, Licensor shall have the option, at its
expense, to: (i) modify the Software to be non-infringing with equivalent or better functionality;
or (ii) obtain for Licensee a license to continue using the Software or, if (i) and (ii) are commercially
impractical, Licensor may terminate this Agreement as to the infringing Software, such termination
being a Release Condition under the Escrow Agreement under which Licensee may access the
Source Code solely as permitted under the Source Code Escrow Agreement and the surviving provisions
of this Agreement. THE FOREGOING STATES LICENSOR’S ENTIRE LIABILITY AND LICENSEE’S EXCLUSIVE
REMEDIES FOR INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS REGARDING THE SOFTWARE.

10.3         “Mutual Indemnity” Each party will indemnify and hold harmless the other party and its directors, officers, employees,
agents and Affiliates against any and all damages, losses, claims, obligations, commitments, costs
or expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees and costs) incurred by such other party that
relate to this Agreement and arise out of the death or bodily injury of any person, to the extent
such death or bodily injury was caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such party
or its employees or agents in the performance of such party’s obligations hereunder, and the
damage, loss or destruction of any real or tangible personal property, to the extent that such damage,
loss or destruction was caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such party or its
employees or agents in the performance of such party’s obligations hereunder; provided, however,
that (a) the indemnified party provides prompt written notice of any such claim(s) to the indemnifying
party and further provided that the failure to so notify will only relieve the indemnifying party
of its obligations under this Section 10 if and to the extent that the indemnifying party is prejudiced
thereby; (b) the indemnifying party has sole control of the defense and all related settlement negotiations;
and (c) the indemnified






8










party furnishes the indemnifying party, at the indemnifying party’s expense, with the assistance,
information, and authority reasonably necessary to perform the obligations set forth in this provision.

11            Confidentiality.

11.1       “Protection of Confidential Information” Except as expressly and unambiguously allowed herein, the receiving party will hold in confidence
and not use, copy or disclose any Confidential Information of the disclosing party and shall similarly
bind its employees and contractors in writing. Nothing herein shall permit the receiving party to
disclose or use, except as explicitly permitted elsewhere in this Agreement, Confidential Information
of the disclosing party and then only on an “as needed” basis for purposes of this Agreement.
For the purpose of clarification, the object code and Documentation for the Licensed Technology are
not Confidential Information, but are required to be protected under other provisions of this Agreement.

11.2         “Disclosures Required by Law” If the receiving party is required to disclose the disclosing party’s Confidential Information
by law or a governmental authority, including pursuant to a subpoena or court order, such Confidential
Information may be disclosed, provided that the receiving party: (a) promptly notifies the disclosing
party of the disclosure requirement; (b) cooperates with the disclosing party’s reasonable efforts
to resist or narrow the disclosure and to obtain an order or other reliable assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded the disclosing party’s Confidential Information; and (c) furnishes
only Confidential Information that the party is legally compelled to disclose according to advice
of its legal counsel.

11.3         “Equitable Relief” Each party acknowledges that its breach of this Section 11 would cause irreparable injury to the other
for which monetary damages are not an adequate remedy. Accordingly, a party will be entitled to injunctions
and other equitable remedies in the event of such a breach by the other. The right of each of the
parties to seek injunctive relief shall not limit in any manner their respective rights to seek other
and/or additional remedies at law or in equity.

12            Limitation on Liability.

EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 12, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE WITH RESPECT TO
ANY SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT UNDER ANY CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, INDEMNIFICATION, STRICT LIABILITY
OR OTHER THEORY: (A) FOR INTERRUPTION OF USE, FOR LOSS OR INACCURACY OR CORRUPTION OF SOFTWARE OR
DATA, OR FOR COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS, SERVICES OR TECHNOLOGY; (B) FOR ANY INDIRECT,

OR (C) FOR ANY AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE AGGREGATE OF FEES PAID TO IT (IN THE CASE OF LICENSOR) OR
(IN THE CASE OF LICENSEE) PAID OR OWED BY IT HEREUNDER. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL NOT APPLY
TO (i) ANY CLAIMS FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR DEATH; (ii) ANY CLAIMS BASED ON A WILLFUL VIOLATION OF EITHER
PARTY’S PROPRIETARY RIGHTS; (iii) EITHER PARTY’S BREACH OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION
11 ABOVE OR (iv) EITHER PARTY’S OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 10. AMOUNTS PAYABLE UNDER SECTION
7 SHALL BE DEEMED DIRECT DAMAGES FOR PURPOSES OF THIS AGREEMENT.

13            Licensor Personnel. Licensor shall provide sufficient and qualified personnel to meet its responsibilities

to Licensee.

14            Reports and Communications. Licensor shall provide a written report at least quarterly to advise Licensee of Licensor’s projected
Upgrades to the Licensed Technology in the ensuing quarter. In addition, the parties will engage
in regular communications as mutually agreed to ensure optimal operations of the Licensed Technology
in License’s operations.

relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and all past dealing or industry custom. As of the
Effective Date, this Agreement shall also supercede the provisions of that certain License Agreement
between the parties dated as of June 30, 2004. This Agreement shall not be modified except by a written
instrument dated subsequent to the Effective Date and signed on behalf of Licensor and Licensee by
their respective duly authorized representatives. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile signature
and in two or more counterparts, all of which taken together will constitute one and the same agreement.

15.5         “Savings Clause” If any provision of this Agreement is prohibited by law or held to be unenforceable, the remaining
provisions hereof shall not be affected, and this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect
as if such unenforceable provision had never constituted a part hereof, and the unenforceable provision
shall be automatically amended so as best to accomplish the objectives of such unenforceable provision
within the limits of applicable law.

15.6         “Relationship of the Parties” Nothing in this Agreement will be construed to constitute either party as the agent, employee or representative
of the other party and no joint venture or partnership will be created hereby. Neither party will
make or have the power or authority to act for, bind or otherwise create or assume any obligation
on behalf of the other party for any purpose whatsoever.

15.7         “No Waiver” No waiver of any breach of any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any prior,
concurrent or subsequent breach of the same or any other provisions hereof, and no waiver shall be
effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party.

15.8         “Force Majeure” Neither party hereto shall be responsible for any failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement
(other than payment and confidentiality obligations under Section 11 above) if such failure

10

this Section 15.10 in the same manner as provided in Section 10.1 above.

15.11       “Bargained for Base” EACH PARTY RECOGNIZES AND AGREES THAT THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIABILITY AND REMEDY LIMITATIONS
IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE MATERIAL BARGAINED FOR BASES OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT THEY HAVE BEEN TAKEN
INTO ACCOUNT AND REFLECTED IN DETERMINING THE CONSIDERATION TO BE GIVEN BY EACH PARTY UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT AND IN THE DECISION BY EACH PARTY TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT.

15.12       “Non-Solicitation” Each party acknowledges the highly competitive nature of the other party’s business
and, accordingly, agrees that it shall not, until the earlier of (i) two years after termination

Condition (as defined in the Escrow Agreement) occurs, solicit, hire or otherwise employ, directly
or indirectly, any officer, director, or employee of the other party without such other party’s prior
written consent. The parties agree that the limitations as to time, geographical area, and scope
of activity to be restrained by this subsection are reasonable and acceptable to the parties, and
do not impose any greater restraint than is reasonably necessary to protect the goodwill and other
business interests of the parties. To the extent a court of competent jurisdiction determines that
language set forth in this subsection does not comply with applicable law of the governing jurisdiction,
this paragraph may be reformed by the court and enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law.

15.13  “Transition Services” Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason, Licensee shall be entitled to continue

Road, Rockville, Maryland 20850(""Licensor."") and is made retroactive to December
3, 2002 (""Effective Date""). All defined terms used in this Amendment No. 1 have
the same meaning as in the License Agreement. The terms and conditions of this
Amendment No. 1 supersede and replace any terms and conditions of the License
Agreement, which are inconsistent with these terms and conditions. All other
terms and conditions of the License Agreement remain in full force and effect.

Whereas, the Parties desire to amend Exhibit A, Software and Royalties, and
Exhibit G, Licensor Support (Software), of the License Agreement; and

Now therefore, the Parties agree as follows:

1. Exhibit A and Exhibit G, attached hereto, shall replace Exhibit A and Exhibit

Exhibit A

SOFTWARE, ROYALTIES, AND SUPPORT COMPENSATION

1. Payment. For each Software copy reproduced and distributed for revenue
by or under the sublicense rights of Cisco, Cisco shall pay a per copy royalty
of [***] of Net Invoice Price received by Cisco from the distribution of the
Software. In the event Software is sold on a stand-alone basis, ""Net Invoice
Price"" shall mean the Cisco's actual revenue received from the distribution of
the Software hereunder, less deductions for refunds, returns, taxes, export fees
and duties.

In the event Software is bundled with other Cisco products, ""Net Invoice Price""
shall mean the amount equal to Licensor's Proportionate Share (as determined
below) of Cisco's actual revenue received from the distribution of the Software
hereunder, less deductions for refunds, returns, taxes, export fees and duties.
""Licensor's Proportionate Share"" shall be determined by dividing the reference
price of the Software by the sum of the list prices of the bundle components.

[***]

2. Payment Terms. All undisputed royalties will be paid quarterly,
pursuant to Cisco's fiscal year. Cisco will provide Licensor within forty-five
(45) days after the end of a Cisco fiscal quarter, (a) a report, substantially
in the form as follows, showing the total invoices sent to Cisco's customers in
the previous quarter and the Net Revenue received therefrom; and (b) a payment
equal to royalties owed to Licensor related thereto (or, if the credits owed to
Cisco hereunder exceed the amount of royalties owed in a particular quarter, an
invoice, payable by Visual within thirty (30) days of receipt, for the amount of
the excess). Cisco shall be entitled to credit for returns of the Software
within [***] days from the date Cisco ships the Software. Any such credit will
be offset against or deducted from royalties or other fees due to Licensor
hereunder. In the event a customer makes a return for which Cisco does not
receive a credit, Cisco shall be entitled to a credit against a future purchase
by the same customer of the returned Software (or a subsequent version of such
Software). To the extent that any royalties are in dispute, the parties agree to
reasonably cooperate to resolve such dispute as quickly as reasonably possible.

Licensor retains complete discretion to change its software product price list
or to discount the list price of its products. Notwithstanding any changes in
Licensor's software product price list, the prices set forth in the Reference
Price List shall not increase during the term of this Agreement. Licensor shall
provide Cisco with written notice of a modification to its software product
price list ninety (90) days before the effective date of any such modification
unless the parties agree in writing to a shorter notice period. If Licensor's
list price on its software products is reduced, Licensor will extend the price
reduction to Cisco as of the date of written notice of such price reduction.

the end of the year to which they pertain, complete records of the Software
manufactured and/or distributed by Cisco in order to calculate and confirm
Cisco's royalty obligations hereunder. Upon reasonable prior notice, Licensor
will have the right, exercisable not more than once every [***] to appoint an
independent accounting firm or other agent reasonably acceptable to Cisco, at
Licensor's expense, to examine such financial books, records and accounts during
Cisco's normal business hours to verify the royalties due from Cisco to Licensor
herein, subject to execution of Cisco's standard confidentiality agreement by
the accounting firm or agent; provided, however, that execution of such
agreement will not preclude such firm from reporting its results to Licensor. In
the event an audit discloses an underpayment or overpayment of royalties due
hereunder, the appropriate party will promptly remit the amounts due to the
other party. If any such audit discloses a shortfall in payment to Licensor of
more than five percent (5%) for any quarter, Cisco agrees to pay or reimburse
Licensor for the expenses of such audit.

support renewal reports for otherwise new support contracts. Licensor's
obligations to submit renewal reports shall cease when Cisco has implemented an
automated ability to track Support Agreement renewals and has provided Licensor
thirty (30) days' advance written notice of such automation.

(c) [***]

(d) Shared Support: Although Cisco will endeavor to discourage Support Agreement
sales and Renewals to Customers by a Cisco service integrator through Cisco's
SIS'98 or other shared support programs (""Shared Support"") when such sale or
renewals are identified and accepted, the same percentage compensation noted in
subparagraph (b) above shall be paid to Licensor.

(e) [***]

(f) Quarterly Report: For Initial Support Agreements and Renewals, Cisco shall
submit (a) a report to Licensor within forty-five (45) days after each Cisco

date of support Software identification numbers, and the total list price; and
(b) a payment equal to support fees owed to Licensor by Cisco in accordance with
this Section 5. Licensor shall identify and advise Cisco of any issues
pertaining to the quarterly reports within fifteen (15) business days after
receipt of Cisco's report. If no issues are raised with such timeframe, the
report shall be deemed accepted by Licensor. Cisco and Licensor will work in
good faith to resolve any issues within a further thirty-day period.

(g) Non-Payment: In the event that Cisco is not in receipt of the invoiced
support fees due from a Customer, Cisco may terminate the support of that
individual Customer, less a pro-rata amount for the Licensor's agreed support
compensation commencing on the date support started through the date that Cisco
notifies Licensor that it has terminated support

(h) Credits: Section 2 of this Exhibit A to the Agreement regarding credit for
returns or offsets against License fees due to Licensor also will apply with
regard to maintenance and support fees. In addition, If a Cisco customer cancels
or terminates its annual maintenance agreement with Cisco for which it has paid
maintenance fees in advance and Cisco provides a pro-rata credit or refund to
the customer of the unused portion of the maintenance fees paid, Licensor will
provide Cisco with a credit or refund in the amount of the unused portion of the
maintenance fees paid to Licensor as of the date Licensor is notified of such
cancellation or termination. On a quarterly basis, Cisco will notify Licensor of
such refund or credit.

training. Such additional training shall be offered to Cisco at a [***] discount
off Licensor's standard pricing for support training. If Cisco assumes
additional support responsibilities, compensation to Licensor shall be
negotiated in good faith at a lower compensation percentage.

4.    SUPPORT

4.1 Software Support. Licensor will support any release of Software for the
longer of: (a) the time until the general availability of the release that is
two releases after such release; and (b) twenty-four (24) months, meaning that
for that time period, Errors in that release will be corrected either by means
of a patch or correction to that release. For a period of twelve (12) months
after the initial Software Support term for a release referenced above, Software
Support shall be offered to Cisco, if requested by Cisco, at Licensor's
reasonable and customary time and materials rates. Subject to the prior written
approval of the Cisco Serviceability Design Engineer for the Software, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, a subsequent release may be
substituted to correct an Error in any Software release. Software releases shall
be downward compatible, so that new releases are compatible with pre-existing
configurations and data formats. Whenever commercially reasonable, Licensor
shall have the capability to electronically transfer Software updates, upgrades,
and patches/fixes to Cisco.

4.2 Customer Support. Cisco will provide Level 0 Support in the same manner that
it provides such support for its other similar Software. Licensor will provide
Level 1 Support, Level 2 Support, and Level 3 Support to a Customer by telephone
and/or e-mail seven (7) days a week, twenty-four (24) hours per day, with a
maximum one (1) hour telephone response time for all Priority 1 and Priority 2
problems. In the event that diagnostics and troubleshooting are required at a
Customer site, as reasonably determined by Cisco, Cisco and Licensor will
provide, at their own expense, the necessary resources for problem resolution in
accordance with each party's respective obligations hereunder. Each party shall
be entitled to recover its actual and reasonable expenses from the other party
or from the Customer if it is later determined that the cause of the problem is
so attributable. Cisco shall provide Licensor feedback on any Software bugs and
potential fixes. Licensor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve
Software bugs.

4.3 Initial Call Flow Process

(a) Customer contacts Cisco's Global Call Center (""GCC"") via Cisco's ""800""
number or the Customer opens their own case on-line via Cisco Case Open Tool.
The GCC shall perform Level 0 Support by verifying customer support entitlement
and opening a case in Cisco's CARE database (""Clarify""). The case is then

<PAGE>


dispatched to the INSMBU-VISUAL NETWORKS CARE queue, which shall generate an
internal case at nfm-Licensor-support@cisco.com, which shall be forwarded to
Licensor's support email alias as provided to Cisco by Licensor Technical
Support Group (""TSG""). INSMBU shall send a page for all P1 and P2 cases to the
appropriate Licensor technical support pager and make reasonable efforts to send
an email message and a message to support@visualnetworks.com and a message via
phone to (800) 708-4784. In that respect, Licensor TSG shall provide its
technical support schedule to Cisco and update such schedule if there are any
changes via email.?? ??Licensor TSG shall report the time that it contacted the
Customer, which is based on the support priority reflected in Section 4.4 below,
and the associated Licensor case number to INSMBU within twenty-four hours after
initial case response. Licensor TSG shall provide INSMBU with case updates on a
weekly basis or more often if reasonably requested by Cisco. In turn, INSMBU
will update cases in CARE on a weekly basis. While Licensor TSG is working on
the case, INSMBU will update the case in CARE stating ""This case is currently
being supported by our third-party Licensor. The LICENSOR case reference is:
XXXX. If you have any questions, please call 1-800-LICENSOR_TSG."" Licensor TSG
will notify INSMBU when the case is ready to be closed. INSMBU will close the
case when resolved, with case details. A customer satisfaction survey, as
reflected in Section 9 hereinbelow, will be sent via CARE to the Customer after
the case is closed.

(b) A troubleshooting tips document for the Software, prepared and maintained by
Licensor TSG, will be made available to Cisco for Customer's on-line use in
troubleshooting the problem, without Cisco's or Licensor's assistance. If the
problem is not resolved, the case will be escalated to Licensor's TSG to perform
Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 Support, as appropriate. Licensor TSG may consult
with INSMBU if necessary, but will work directly with the Customer to resolve a
Software problem. INSMBU may occasionally call Licensor's TSG directly for case
status.

(c) When Cisco's Customer Support database is modified by Cisco to allow
appropriate supplier access, Licensor and Cisco will work in good faith to
develop a call flow transition plan so that all case information is updated and
transferred to the Cisco database.

4.4 Support Prioritization and Escalation Guidelines. To ensure that all
Software problems and technical inquiries are reported in a standard format,
Licensor will use and comply with the problem priority definitions and
escalation guidelines herein pursuant to Section 3.2. Based on the priority of a
Software problem, Licensor will provide to Cisco fixes or work-arounds in the
following time frames:

o     Priority 1: Fix or work-around within eight (8) hours of problem
report to Licensor;

U.S. Software License Agreement

This U.S. Software License  Agreement  (the  ""Agreement"")  is made and
entered   into  by  and  between   MicroStrategy   Incorporated,   a  Delaware
corporation  having its  principal  place of business at 8000 Towers  Crescent
Drive, Vienna, VA 22182 (""MSTR""),  and Strategy.com  Incorporated,  a Delaware
corporation  having its  principal  place of  business  at 1861  International
drive, Vienna,  Virginia 22182 (""SDC""),  (each one individually a ""Party"" and,
collectively,  the  ""Parties"").  The effective date of this Agreement shall be
the date last signed below (the ""Effective Date"").

WITNESSETH

WHEREAS,  MicroStrategy Incorporated and certain of its subsidiaries desire
to realign their worldwide corporate structure in accordance with their separate
lines of business, the ""Strategy.com Business"" and the ""MicroStrategy Business"";
and

WHEREAS,  the entities now enter into various  agreements  and make certain
mutual  promises as described in the ""Agreement and Plan of  Reorganization""  by
and  among  MicroStrategy  Incorporated,  MicroStrategy  International  Limited,
MicroStrategy   International  II  Limited,   Strategy.com   Incorporated,   and
Strategy.com  International  Limited dated October 17,  2000 to effectuate  this
realignment and reorganization; and

WHEREAS,   MSTR  has  developed   the  suite  of  software   known  as  the
MicroStrategy  platform (as further defined below) and other technology  related
to a  personalized  information  network.  SDC desires to acquire  rights in the
MicroStrategy platform; and

WHEREAS,  SDC is  currently  using the  MicroStrategy  platform  in certain
existing projects which the Parties agree SDC should be permitted to continue.

NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration of the premises set forth above and the
covenants set forth below,  and other  valuable  consideration,  the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

AGREEMENT

1.    Definitions

As used in this Agreement,  capitalized terms will have the meanings set forth
below.

1.1 ""Affiliate"" means a company that provides Services to its customers via
an affiliation with SDC and that has signed an affiliation agreement with SDC.

1.2  ""MicroStrategy  Platform"" means all existing and future  MicroStrategy
products that are made generally available  including,  without limitation,  the
MicroStrategy  E-Business platforms known as MicroStrategy 6.0 and MicroStrategy
7.0  (or any  derivative  works  thereof),  MicroStrategy  Intelligence  Server,
MicroStrategy  Web  Server,   MicroStrategy   Broadcast  Server,   MicroStrategy
Architect, MicroStrategy Administrator, MicroStrategy Agent, MicroStrategy

<PAGE>

Web,   MicroStrategy    InfoCenter,  MicroStrategy   Transactor,   MicroStrategy
Broadcaster,  MicroStrategy  Telecaster,  the MicroStrategy Software Development
Kit (SDK) and the  MicroStrategy  eCRM 6  application.  The MSTR Products  shall
include,  at no charge to SDC, all upgrades and bug fixes as are made  generally
available through MicroStrategy technical support.

1.3  ""Intellectual  Property  (IP) Rights""  means all patents,  copyrights,
trade names,  trademarks,  trade  secrets,  or any other  intellectual  property
rights, whether registered or unregistered essential to undertake the activities
licensed hereunder.

1.4 ""Services"" means syndicated information services covering a broad range
of content distributed to end users through a network of affiliates,  as well as
offering  targeted  advertising  and  e-commerce  offers to consumers  through a
network of affiliates or through a specific  affiliate and offering reporting on
subscriber  information.  Services  may also mean the  provision  of  customized
services to a specific affiliate using any combination of syndicated data and/or
data  provided by the  affilate and the  information  is sent by SDC directly to
consumers on behalf of the affiliate.  Services specifically exclude the ability
of SDC to host applications  (e.g., eCRM applications and business  intelligence
applications)  that analyze customer data that is unrelated to Subscription Data
and that would essentially compete with MicroStrategy's  products and offerings.
Subscription  Data is any information  about a subscriber that is collected as a
part of delivering the Services.

1.5 ""Software""  means those certain  software modules that make up the MSTR
Platform, and any related technical documentation.

1.6  ""Subsidiary""  means a  corporation  or  other  legal  entity:  (i) the
majority of whose  shares or other  securities  entitled to vote for election of
directors (or other managing  authority) is now or hereafter  controlled by such
company either directly or indirectly;  or (ii) which does not have  outstanding
publicly  traded  shares  or  securities  but the  majority  of whose  ownership
interest representing the right to manage such corporation or other legal entity
is now or hereafter  owned and  controlled  by such company  either  directly or
indirectly;  but any such  corporation or the other legal entity shall be deemed
to be a Subsidiary of such company only as long as such control or ownership and
control exists.

1.7   ""Territory"" shall mean the United States.

2.    License Grants

2.1  Object  Code  License.  Subject  to the terms and  conditions  of this
Agreement,   MSTR  hereby  grants  to  SDC  a   nonexclusive,   nontransferable,
royalty-free license, without right of sublicense except as set forth in Section
2.3  below,   to  make,   use,   and  provide   access  to  the   Software   (in
machine-executable  object  code form  only) only for use  within  SDC's  normal
business  operations to support and operate the Services and for SDC's  internal
business intelligence needs.

2.2  Source  Code  License.  MSTR  hereby  grants  to  SDC a  nonexclusive,
nontransferable,   perpetual,   and  royalty-free  license,   without  right  of
sublicense,  to use the  Software in source  code form to develop  and  maintain
derivative  works of the  Software  only for use within  SDC's  normal  business
operations  to support and operate the Services in the  Territory.  MSTR further
grants to SDC a nonexclusive, nontransferable, perpetual, worldwide

2
<PAGE>

and  royalty-free  license,  without  right of  sublicense  to use and provide
access to the  derivative  works of the  Software  to support  and operate the
Services  in the  Territory.  Nothing  in this  Agreement  shall  give SDC any
right to make the  source  code of the MSTR  platform  available  to any third
party.

2.3  License  Restrictions.  SDC shall  not  authorize  others  to  reverse
compile,  reverse  engineer or otherwise  disassemble the Software or derivative
works of the  Software.  SDC  agrees  to take no  actions  inconsistent  with or
exceeding  the scope of the  license  grant set forth in  Sections  2.1 and 2.2.
Specifically,  SDC shall not permit any third party access to the Source Code of
the Software.  Except for the rights  expressly  granted in this Agreement,  all
rights to the Software and any Intellectual Property Rights therein are reserved
by MSTR.  When SDC makes the Software  available to a third party as part of the
Services,  SDC must do so solely through a written sublicense agreement,  either
in a written form or a ""click-wrap"" form (""End User License  Agreement""),  which
shall be in the form provided by  MicroStrategy  or in a form prepared by SDC so
long as such End User  License  Agreement  includes,  at a minimum,  contractual
provisions at least as restrictive as the following, which:

(a)   Disclaim  MicroStrategy's  liability  for  damages,  whether
direct or indirect,  incidental or consequential,  arising from the use of the
Software.
(b)   Require end users to use a  commercially  reasonable  degree
of care to protect the Confidential  Information of MicroStrategy and prohibit
End  Users  from,   directly  or  indirectly,   (1)  using  any   Confidential
Information of MicroStrategy  to create any computer  software program or user
documentation which is substantially  similar to any Software, or (2) using or
disclosing Confidential Information of MicroStrategy.
(c)   The   End   User   License   Agreement   shall   not   cause
MicroStrategy  to be liable for any taxes or  duties,  however  designated  or
levied (including but not limited to sales, use and personal property).
(d)   Notwithstanding  any provisions to the contrary contained in
this  Agreement  and for the  avoidance of doubt,  SDC shall have the right to
use and/or  sublicense  the  Software  solely for the purpose of  licensing or
offering the Services as defined in the U.S. Software  Licensing  agreement to
a third party that relicenses the Services for example an OEM relationship.

MicroStrategy  reserves  the right to amend the minimum  required  contractual
provisions  set forth in this Section upon ninety (90) days'  advance  written
notice,  provided such amended provisions shall apply only to End User License
Agreements  executed  by SDC  subsequent  to  the  expiration  of  the  ninety
(90)-day notice period.

2.4 Assignment and Transfer.  SDC may not assign this Agreement or transfer
Software to an Affiliate without prior written consent of MicroStrategy.

3
<PAGE>

2.5   Audit.

(a)   Certification.   At  MicroStrategy's  written  request,  not
more  frequently  than once per year, SDC shall furnish  MicroStrategy  with a
signed  certification  verifying  that the Software is being used  pursuant to
the provisions of this Agreement.

(b)   Audit.  MicroStrategy  may, at its expense,  audit SDC's use
of the Products.  Any such audit shall be conducted  during  regular  business
hours at SDC's  facilities  and shall not  unreasonably  interfere  with SDC's
business activities.


3.    Ownership.

3.1 Ownership. As between SDC and MSTR, SDC acknowledges that MSTR owns all
right,  title  and  interest  in the  MSTR  Platform,  and to the  Software  and
derivative works created pursuant to Section 2.2.

3.2 Proprietary Rights Notices.  SDC shall not alter, obscure or remove any
copyright  notices or any other proprietary  rights notices  incorporated in the
Software delivered to SDC.


4.    Confidentiality

The parties  agree to treat all  confidential  information  exchanged by
the parties as  confidential  as set forth in the U.S.  Mutual  Non-Disclosure
Agreement in effect between the parties and  incorporated in this Agreement by
reference.


5.    Warranty

5.1.  Limited  Exclusivity.  MSTR warrants that for a period of three years
from the execution of this  Agreement it will not both grant a software  license
and  provide  MSTR  consulting   services  pursuant  to  which  MSTR  builds  an
application  for a customer that would allow the non-MSTR  controlled  entity to
compete  directly  with  Strategy.com  as a provider of  syndicated  information
services to a network of affiliates.  MSTR further warrants that for a period of
three  years  from  the  execution  of this  Agreement,  it will  not  create  a
syndicated  information service for distribution through a network of affiliates
that competes directly with the Services.

5.2.  Rights  Ownership.  MSTR warrants that it owns, free and clear of all
liens or  encumbrances,  or has valid  licenses in the  Software and that it has
full legal right to grant to SDC the licenses contained herein.

5.3.  Disclaimer of Warranties.  MSTR offers no warranties other than those
specifically set in this Section and to the extent permitted by law specifically
disclaim  all others,  including  merchantability  and fitness for a  particular
purpose.

5.4. No  Additional  Warranties.  SDC shall make no warranties on behalf of
MSTR and agrees to  indemnify  and hold MSTR  harmless  from any claims based on
warranties given in violation of this Agreement.

4
<PAGE>

6.  Indemnification

6.1   Indemnification  of SDC.  MSTR  shall  defend and  indemnify  SDC,
against and hold SDC harmless  from any and all claims that the  MicroStrategy
Platform  infringes  a United  States  patent or  copyright  of a third  party
provided  that SDC: (i) promptly  notifies  MSTR in writing of any such claim;
(ii)  allows  MSTR  to have  sole  control  of the  defense  and  all  related
settlement  negotiations;  and  (iii)  provides  MSTR  with  the  information,
authority and assistance  necessary to perform MSTR's  obligations  under this
Section.  In the event  the  MicroStrategy  Platform  is held or  believed  to
infringe,  MSTR may,  at its sole  option:  (i)  obtain  for SDC a license  to
continue using the MicroStrategy  Platform product, (ii) replace or modify the
MicroStrategy   Platform  product  so  that  it  becomes  noninfringing  while
retaining  substantially  similar  functionality;  or (iii) if neither (i) nor
(ii) can be  reasonably  effected  by MSTR,  credit to SDC the prices paid for
the MicroStrategy  Platform product during the twelve (12) months prior to the
credit,  provided  that such  MicroStrategy  Platform  product are returned to
MSTR  in an  undamaged  condition  and  all  licenses  to  such  MicroStrategy
Platform product are terminated.

6.2   Excluded  Claims.  Notwithstanding  Section 6.1 above,  MSTR shall
not  be  liable  to  SDC  for  any  claim  arising  from  or  based  upon  the
combination,  operation  or use of any  MicroStrategy  Platform  product  with
equipment,  data  or  programming  not  supplied  by MSTR  (including  the SDC
software and  services) or for other than an intended  purpose as set forth in
the User Documentation,  or arising from any alteration or modification of the
MicroStrategy  Platform  product,  if the claim would not have arisen  without
such alteration or modification.

6.3   Indemnification  of MSTR.  SDC shall  defend  and  indemnify  MSTR
(including  paying all  reasonable  attorneys'  fees and costs of  litigation)
against  and hold MSTR  harmless  from any and all  claims by any other  party
resulting   from   SDC's   negligent   or   tortious   acts,    omissions   or
misrepresentations  relating  to the  marketing,  sublicensing,  distribution,
demonstration,  evaluation  or  use of the  MicroStrategy  Platform  products,
regardless  of the form of action  provided that MSTR:  (i) promptly  notifies
SDC in writing of any such claim;  (ii) allows SDC to have sole control of the
defense and all related settlement  negotiations;  and (iii) provides SDC with
the  information,   authority  and  assistance   necessary  to  perform  SDC's
obligations under this Section.

7.    Limitation of Liability

EXCEPT FOR BREACHES OF SECTIONS 2 AND 4 HEREOF,  IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER
PARTY BE  LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY  CONSEQUENTIAL,  INCIDENTAL  OR  SPECIAL
DAMAGES,  INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS, LOSS OF
COMPUTER  TIME,  DESTRUCTION  OR DAMAGE OF RECORDS,  WHETHER  SUCH CLAIM IS IN
CONTRACT OR IN TORT,  EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN  ADVISED OF THE  POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES.

The provisions of this Agreement allocate the risks between  MicroStrategy and
SDC.  MicroStrategy's  pricing  reflects  this  allocation  of  risk  and  the
limitation of liability specified in this Agreement.

5
<PAGE>

8.    Termination

8.1  Termination.  The  Agreement  will  terminate  at  the  option  of the
non-breaching  Party upon  thirty  (30) days  written  notice if the other Party
breaches or defaults on any material  obligation  under this Agreement and fails
to cure such breach or default during such 30-day period.

8.2 Obligation Upon Termination.  Upon termination of this Agreement,  each
Party shall  promptly  return to the other all  Confidential  Information of the
other Party then in its possession.

8.3 Survival. Sections 4, 5, 6, 8.3, and 9 shall survive any termination,
expiration or cancellation of this Agreement.


9.    Dispute Resolution

9.1   General Provisions.

(a)   If a dispute arises out of or relates to this Agreement,  or
the breach,  termination or validity thereof,  the parties agree to submit the
dispute to a sole  mediator  selected  by the  parties  or, at any time at the
option  of a party,  to  mediation  by the  American  Arbitration  Association
(""AAA"").  If not  thus  resolved,  it shall  be  referred  to a panel of three
arbitrators  selected by the parties within thirty (30) days of the mediation,
or in the  absence  of such  selection,  to AAA  arbitration  which  shall  be
governed by the United  States  Arbitration  Act. The ruling of any such panel
shall be binding.

(b)   Any award made (i) shall be an award  affording  such remedy
as is deemed  equitable,  just and  within the scope of this  Agreement;  (ii)
shall be with  findings  as to issues  (including  but not  limited  to patent
validity  and/or  infringement)  or a statement of the  reasoning on which the
award  rests;  (iii)  may  in  appropriate  circumstances  include  injunctive
relief;  (iv) shall be made within four (4) months of the  appointment  of the
arbitrator; and (v) may be entered in any court.

(c)   The requirement  for mediation and arbitration  shall not be
deemed a waiver of any  right of  termination  under  this  Agreement  and the
arbitrator  is now  empowered to act or make any award other than based solely
on the rights and obligations of the parties prior to any such termination.

(d)   The arbitrator shall determine  issues of arbitrability  but
may not limit, expand or otherwise modify the terms of this Agreement.

(e)   This Agreement  shall be interpreted in accordance  with the
laws  of the  Commonwealth  of  Virginia  exclusive  of its  conflict  of laws
provisions and the place of mediation and arbitration shall be Fairfax County.

(f)   Each party shall bear its own expenses but those  related to
the  compensation  and expenses of the mediator and arbitrator  shall be borne
equally.

<PAGE>

9.2 Relationship Between Parties. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
be construed as creating a joint  venture,  partnership,  agency,  or employment
relationship  between the Parties, and neither Party will have the right to bind
the other or incur any  obligation  on the  other's  behalf  without the other's
prior written consent.

9.3   Waiver.  The  failure  of  either  Party  to  exercise  any  right
granted herein or to require any  performance of any term of this Agreement or
the waiver by either Party of any breach of this Agreement,  shall not prevent
a subsequent  exercise or enforcement of the term or be deemed a waiver of any
subsequent breach of the same or any other term of this Agreement.

9.4 Headings. The section headings appearing in this Agreement are inserted
only as a  matter  of  convenience  and in no way  define,  limit,  construe  or
describe  the scope or intent of any such  section  nor in any way  affect  this
Agreement.

9.5 Assignment.  Neither party may assign this Agreement  without the prior
written  consent  of the  other  party.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing  to the
contrary,  either party may assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder to
any one or more of its  Subsidiaries.  Each  party  acknowledges  that it  shall
continue to be  obligated if and to the extent that a permitted  assignee  under
this paragraph  fails to perform the  obligations  that such party has assigned.
Any attempted assignment in violation of this paragraph without consent shall be
null and void

9.6 Export Control.  The Parties  acknowledge  that the distribution of the
Software,  any derivative works thereof, and any technical data related thereto,
is subject to the export control laws of the United States of America, including
the U.S.  Bureau of Export  Administration  regulations,  as  amended,  and each
hereby  agrees to obey any and all such laws.  The Parties agree not to take any
actions  that would  cause  either  Party to violate  the U.S.  Foreign  Corrupt
Practices Act of 1977, as amended.

9.7   U.S. Government  Restricted Rights.  Products acquired with United
States Federal  Government  funds or intended for use within or for any United
States  federal  agency are provided  with  ""LIMITED  RIGHTS"" and  ""RESTRICTED
RIGHTS"" as defined in DFARS 252.227-7013 and/or FAR 52.227-19.

9.8 Entire  Agreement.  This  Agreement  and the exhibits  attached  hereto
constitute  the  complete,  final and  exclusive  understanding  of the  Parties
regarding the subject matter hereof and cancels and supersedes any and all prior
negotiations,  correspondence,  understandings  and agreements,  whether oral or
written, between the Parties respecting the subject matter thereof.

EXHIBIT 10.28

SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT

This Software  License  Agreement is made as of this 21st day of September,
1999,  between Preferred Voice,  Inc., a Delaware  corporation  (""Licensor"") and
Southwest Texas Telephone Company, a Texas corporation,  on behalf of itself and
its wholly owned subsidiaries and affiliates (""Licensee""). Licensor and Licensee
are collectively referred to in this Agreement as the ""Parties.""

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Licensor has  developed a system (the  ""System"")  that when  interconnected
with a telephone  switching  system is capable of  performing  the services (the
""Services"")  described in a Marketing Agreement between Licensor and Licensee of
even date (the  ""Marketing  Agreement"").  Each System  consists of the hardware,
certain  third  party   software  (the  ""Third  Party   Software"")  and  certain
proprietary   application  software  developed  by  Licensor  (the  ""Application
Software"").  Licensee is a licensed  local  exchange  carrier  that is currently
providing  telecommunications  service in local calling  areas  described in the
Marketing Agreement (the ""Service Areas""). Licensee wishes to offer the Services
to end  users  (""End  Users"")  under  its own  brand  in  conjunction  with  its
telecommunications  services,  and  Licensor has agreed to install its System in
Licensee's location for that purpose pursuant to the Marketing Agreement.

In  consideration  of the mutual promises made in this Agreement,  Licensor
and Licensee agree that the terms and conditions set forth as follows will apply
to the license of Application Software.

ARTICLE 1. LICENSE AND PROCUREMENT

1.01  LICENSE.  Pursuant  to this  Agreement,  Licensor  hereby  grants  to
Licensee  a  nontransferable,  non-exclusive  license  to  use  the  Application
Software, together with all subsequent improvements thereto in the Service Area.

1.02 TERM.  The initial term of this  Agreement  shall be  co-terminus  wit
Marketing Agreement.

ARTICLE 2. LIMITATIONS ON USE

2.01 GENERAL USE. Licensee agrees to use the Application Software solely to
provide the Services to End Users.  Licensee  may private  brand the Services it
offers.



SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT - 1



<PAGE>

2.02 LOCATION.

(a) Use of Application Software.  The Application Software may be used
only on the  hardware  provided  by  Licensor  (""Designated  Hardware"")  at
Licensee's switch locations in the Licensed Areas.

(b) Temporary Use of Non-Desiqnated Hardware. Licensee may temporarily
install and use the Application  Software on hardware other than Designated
Hardware,  but only if the  Designated  Hardware  cannot be used because of
hardware,  software  or other  malfunction  and only  until the  Designated
Hardware is returned to  operation.  Licensee  shall not install or use the
Application  Software on such replacement hardware without the prior verbal
consent of Licensor.  Licensor shall not unreasonably withhold this consent
