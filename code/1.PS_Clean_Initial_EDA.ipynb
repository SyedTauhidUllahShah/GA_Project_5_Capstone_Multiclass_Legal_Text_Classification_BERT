    "## Problem Statement \n",
    "Contracts can be long, dense and inaccessible, and a quick way to summarize the topics can give at least a good bird's eye view for legal stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we use NLP models like Transformers or LDA (TBC) to summarize the topics of a contract's content? To measure success, we will use perplexity and coherence, which are topic modelling classification metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perplexity captures how surprised a model is of new data it has not seen before, and is measured as the normalized log-likelihood of a held-out test set - how well does the model represent or reproduce the statistics of the held-out data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic Coherence measures score a single topic by measuring the degree of semantic similarity between high scoring words in the topic. These measurements help distinguish between topics that are semantically interpretable topics and topics that are artifacts of statistical inference. \n",
    "\n",

If we didn’t make a mistake, you may \\nhave to pay finance charges, and you will have to make up any missed payments on the questioned amount. In either case, we will send you a statement of the amount you \\nowe and the date that it is due. \\n•     If you fail to pay the amount that we think you owe, we may report you as delinquent. However, if our explanation does not satisfy you and you write to us within ten \\ndays telling us that you still refuse to pay, we must tell anyone we report you to that you have a question about your bill.

    "Thanks to pdf miner, we were able to convert our single pdf file into a gigantic string. As is expected, however, that conversion wasn't perfect - there were lots of unwanted characters, spaces, quotation marks etc. These had to be cleaned out and processed using `WordVectorizer` in order to get our bag of words that we could bring out into intial visualizations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our initial EDA of this sample contract tells us that the top few words relate to \"party\", \"trademark\", \"eclipse\" and \"agreement\". \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Party\" and \"agreement\" aren't very special in a contract as they simply refer to the contract itself and the people who are the parties to it. However, drawing from my own subject expertise in law, the following words have special legal meanings:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trademark**: The second highest word count at 29 counts indicates that the agreement has to do with a trademark agreement. In a trademark licence agreement, the proprietor (Licensor) of a registered trademark gives authorization to another company (Licensee) to manufacture and distribute products under this trademark: https://www.globalnegotiator.com/international-trade/dictionary/trademark-license-agreement/#:~:text=Trade%20Tradem%20Tradeo-,Trademark%20license%20agreement,distribute%20products%20under%20this%20trademark.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Domain Name** and **Eclipse** : That trademark agreement centers around the company's domain name \"Eclipse\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Title Interest**: This refers to the title and interest a.k.a the legal rights to use the \"Domain Name\", which is being assigned."

    "### What This Means for Modelling\n",
    "The intrinsically technical nature of contracts makes it easy to bring out keywords, which in turn should ideally help us to boost the accuracy of topic modelling. We have only run this clean on sample contract, however.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although I have a corpus of ~1000+ contracts at about nearly **800MB**, I haven't yet figured out how to write a for loop that does all of the above actions - including the pdf into dataframe row conversion - into one gigantic dataframe for the entire corpus. That will require further research, but for now we can see that the preliminary potential of topic modelling around contracts will work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The somewhat large dataset may mean that I may be best served running the eventual giant clean and convert to the cloud or a hybrid of the cloud and on-premise computing. "
